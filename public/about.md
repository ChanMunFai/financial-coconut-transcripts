# About

This site is created by [Chan Mun Fai](https://chanmunfai.github.io) and is unaffilated to the Financial Coconut Podcast. This is purely a hobbyist project with no commercial interests. I do not have any intentions to monetise this project in the future. 

Inspired by Aleska Gordic and Lex Friedman, this is my attempt in building a full-stack ML project. On the backend, I used OpenAI's Whisper (speech-to-text) model to transcribe videos from the Financial Coconut Podcast. 

However, noticing the peculiarities of the Singaporean-accented English, I first *finetuned my model on XX hours** of Singaporean-accented English, attaining an improvement in the error rate from 13% to 6%. More training details can be found in this repository.
