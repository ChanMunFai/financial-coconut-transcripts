about it in a later episode.", "205.8": "But yes, that is the good thing that came out of it.", "208.64": "I picked up the habit of reading and I've realized that it is not because I don't like",

"books.", "267.76": "Average are going to like 50, 60, hundreds of dollars.", "272.16": "You get the idea.", "273.32": "Some of the books are a little bit more expensive.", "275.64": "And yes, if you can get it from the library, go ahead.", "278.2": "But you realize that the library has its limits at times.", "282.12": "If you really want to learn something, learn something fast, and just so happen that the", "285.76": "library doesn't have the book or the book is consistently being leased out, you could", "290.24": "save with the library of course.", "291.96": "But if it's not available, you may want to consider spending a little bit and buy.", "296.44": "I think it's cool.", "297.44": "And a book is a good gift also.", "298.92": "If you buy the book and you like the book, you can

on YouTube, or listen to my podcast, listen", "323.36": "to other podcasts.", "324.36": "If you're listening on Spotify, you realize that hey, there are tons of good podcasts", "328.32": "here and of course, even in SoundCloud, there are many other places that have great podcasts.", "333.96": "I think in our part of the world, we're not listening to enough podcasts.", "338.36": "So maybe you want to listen to more.", "339.76": "I get it.", "340.76": "Videos, audios, great way to learn.", "343.96": "So many platforms, Udemy, Skillshare, all these different places, amazing ways to learn.", "350.32": "But why I think books are still very fundamental, because think about it, where do all these", "355.04": "people get their knowledge?", "357.36": "Many of them got it from books.", "360.4": "Why?", "361.6": "Books take a long time to publish and it takes a lot of capital to publish books.", "366.52": "So to be able to get a publisher to publish, there's a whole process of proofreading, of", "373.6": "editing and making sure everything is accurate and up to standard, which is why to me, books", "381.08": "have the most rigorous process of putting information together, rather than podcast,", "388.32": "rather than video.", "389.68": "All these are great platforms.", "390.96": "Don't get me wrong, I'm a podcaster.", "393.8": "But where do we get our knowledge?", "396.2": "We get from books.", "397.2": "So I think you should read books because they're the most rigorous.", "400.76": "And that's why you should add a book fund into your monthly spending.", "405.04": "Why not?", "406.04": "Read some books, pick up something.", "408.48": "And you don't need to read self-help or investing books all the time.", "414.72": "Start with something that you love.", "416.24": "Pick up a book about coffee, pick up a book about tea, pick up a book about photography.", "421.2": "Photography books are quite expensive.", "423.56": "So pick up a book about something you love and start there.", "427.2": "It's a great place to learn.", "428.2": "The content is a lot more rigorous than what you get online.", "431.8": "And it's not that expensive.", "432.8": "One of the cheapest ways to learn are by books.", "435.68": "So I feel one of the things that you should include in your budget is a book fund.", "440.68": "Do it.", "441.68": "And the next thing that I feel you should include in your budget is this thing that", "445.64": "I call an exploration fund.", "448.44": "Yeah, yeah.", "450.68": "Exploration explore what, right?", "453.0": "How many of you on the other end have ever came across this thought that, oh my goodness,", "457.36": "I'm so bored.", "459.28": "Work is so boring.", "460.28": "It's the same thing again and again and again.", "463.48": "And I'm burning out.", "464.48": "I want to try something new.", "465.56": "I want to take on a different job.", "466.84": "I want to shift my career.", "467.84": "I want to change this.", "468.84": "I want to do that.", "470.2": "I'm quite sure at least 80 to 90% of you guys have experienced something like that.", "476.16": "It's fair, especially when you're really good at what you do.", "479.08": "And to me, that is where boredom comes from.", "483.72": "You're so good at what you do.", "485.12": "You've been doing it again and again and again and again and again and again.", "487.64": "You get bored.", "488.64": "It's like playing games, right?", "490.0": "You play a game.", "491.0": "At first, very exciting.", "492.32": "But after a while, you know how to play the game.", "494.2": "Oh my goodness, so boring now.", "496.44": "Sian already, right?", "497.44": "You want to quit the game.", "498.6": "And then you find another game and it looks interesting.", "500.76": "And then you realize, oh, this game, even easier to crack.", "503.98": "After a while, you get bored.", "505.56": "You delete it.", "506.56": "Same idea.", "507.56": "So when you get bored, when you get so good at something, you become bored.", "511.18": "And you think that you want to change it.", "512.94": "You think that you want to make progress, which is fair.", "517.18": "But in a job setting or in your financial health, many a times, that may not be the", "521.38": "wisest choice.", "523.42": "If you really feel that you want to move on from your job, cool, go ahead.", "527.1": "If you really feel that you want to take on something new, you want to start a new challenge,", "530.22": "you want to start a new startup, you want to start working.", "535.74": "You want to start a company, you want to change a department, you want to promote and progress,", "538.62": "create cool stuff, do what you believe.", "541.5": "But recognize that many a times, it is just our underlying boredom disturbing us.", "548.38": "And to me, I believe that there is an underlying desire for progress in all of us.", "554.78": "That is why we get to where we are.", "556.94": "That's why the human civilization is where we are today.", "560.02": "And I stand by it.", "561.74": "Because if you think about it, even if people tell you, oh, I'm retired, they're actually", "565.1": "making progress in other aspects of life.", "567.22": "They're trying to make progress in their relationships, they're trying to make progress in their health,", "571.82": "they're trying to make progress in their interests, they're trying to become a hobbyist.", "576.26": "We're all wanting to make progress.", "578.02": "We all need to work, we all want to make progress, we just focus on different things at different", "582.62": "time in life.", "584.1": "So to me, we get bored.", "586.14": "And we don't exactly need to change our job or quit our job just because we are bored.", "591.34": "We just need to solve that boredom.", "594.38": "So include an exploration fund.", "596.9": "It could be $100, it could be $50, depending on what is comfortable in your budget.", "603.98": "And explore something.", "605.18": "Buy a new board game, go for a new class, pick up a new sport, try a new thing.", "612.14": "Yeah, that is the idea of exploration, trying something that you've never tried before.", "617.22": "And that will make sure you're not bored at all.", "619.1": "You will never get bored if you can consistently explore.", "622.06": "It is because when we start working, we dedicate so much of our lives to work.", "626.86": "We dedicate 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, my goodness, I have friends who work in accounting,", "632.46": "big 4, like 16 hours to work, almost every day I work.", "637.66": "Yeah, and we dedicate so much time to work, after that we go home, we sleep, we end up", "642.38": "not socialising with our friends as much, we start to skip the gym, we start to do this,", "647.58": "we start to drop a lot of things that we used to have.", "650.86": "And that's why we get bored very easily, alright, because there's nothing new in our life,", "655.18": "every day is just work, ma.", "656.78": "So why not spend a little bit of budget to explore?", "660.06": "Give yourself that $50, that $100, do spontaneous things, go rock climbing, go for, learn how", "665.74": "to dance, pick up a ballet, or, you know, join a new board game group, buy a new board", "671.5": "game, go for archery, or learn how to code, play chess, anything and everything under", "678.38": "the sky, there's so many platforms that you can do.", "681.02": "I would recommend you to use meetup.com, search on Eventbrite, I think Facebook have a lot", "686.3": "of good events also, but set aside a budget for you to do random things and for you to", "690.46": "explore.", "691.1": "That will make your life a lot more exciting, a lot more fun, and less bored.", "695.18": "You will not really need to keep changing jobs.", "697.9": "And why do I try to let you realise this thing?", "701.58": "Because if you stick to something long enough, you level up, you become that much better", "708.46": "and you get to progress.", "711.1": "Yes, of course you can always change your job and progress, or you can start a new company", "715.5": "and progress, fair.", "716.94": "But I think some governing fundamentals is that if you stick to something long enough,", "721.82": "you become an expert, you become that good at it, you can start to see more things, the", "726.06": "ins and the outs, and you get more opportunities because you are that good at it.", "730.46": "So don't always change your job just because you are bored.", "733.42": "Recognise that you are bored because you are not exploring and set aside a budget, go and", "737.82": "try something new and explore.", "739.42": "Fair?", "739.98": "Yeah, give it a shot and let me know what you have tried, let me know interesting things", "744.06": "that you have done.", "745.02": "Email me or Facebook message me, okay?", "747.34": "I want to get some ideas as to what kind of interesting things I can do.", "751.5": "Singapore, KL, anywhere, I am open to ideas.", "755.02": "The last thing that I feel you should include in your budget is something I call giving.", "761.9": "Yeah, yeah, a bit cheesy, a lot of people say you must give back to society, give to", "766.06": "charity, give all those kind of different things.", "769.26": "But in my view, giving is just something that allows me to realise certain fundamentals", "775.26": "of society, certain fundamentals of life.", "779.34": "That everything is but a gift.", "781.42": "If we realise it is all in a circle, we are where we are because we are given an opportunity,", "786.3": "we are where we are because we are given a good education, we are where we are because", "790.46": "our parents had a good time at night and gave birth to us.", "794.38": "So everything is a process of giving and it is a cycle.", "798.14": "Many a times if we keep taking and taking and taking and we stop giving, we realise", "802.46": "that this is a cycle, we stop realising that we are so connected in actuality to people", "809.02": "around us, to things around us, to the environment and to every little thing.", "813.98": "We are all connected and giving helps you to do that.", "818.38": "I am not saying giving in a sense that you need to buy a rice, buy a huge 25kg of rice", "824.06": "to donate to the temple or go to invest to donate to a charity, to go for different kind", "831.1": "of causes, you don't need to do that.", "833.26": "Giving is just giving.", "835.58": "You could buy a gift, maybe your colleagues, they have worked really hard, buy them a gift,", "844.06": "maybe it can be a bubble tea, oh my goodness, why did I say bubble tea?", "847.82": "Oh yeah, it is just an act of giving.", "850.54": "Or maybe it is the cleaning auntie downstairs that is always cleaning the tables and making", "857.34": "sure the hawker centre is clean or decently clean.", "860.22": "Trust me, they don't make a lot, we will talk about that in another episode.", "863.82": "But yeah, buy them a coffee, buy them a loaf of bread, give them some biscuits, just give", "869.1": "something.", "869.9": "You don't need to go the really extra mile to give, do little acts of giving.", "875.34": "Oh, give your mum a hug, yeah I have not given my mum a hug in a long time, I probably should.", "880.94": "Just anything, just give.", "883.98": "And honestly, giving, you don't really need a lot of money but why not set aside a budget", "888.14": "to give, give more and realise that everything is a cycle.", "892.7": "The more you give, the more gifts are going around, the chances of you getting more gifts,", "897.34": "hey, a lot higher.", "899.02": "And there is one initiative in Tampines where I grew up, I want to talk about, it is this", "905.9": "initiative called My Kind Fridge.", "908.62": "Essentially, it is some people that donated their fridge and the town council has allowed", "916.22": "them to put these fridges at certain locations in Tampines, which uses the town council electricity,", "924.94": "it is a place where you can give your vegetables, you buy extra veggies, you can give, you buy", "931.74": "extra oatmeal, you can give, you cook extra pastries, cakes, you can give and you can", "937.82": "just put inside the fridge and most of the time, these fridges are located in places", "943.34": "that have more older generation or rental houses, you know, people that will appreciate", "951.18": "good things that you, great food and good things that you give them.", "954.78": "So yeah, I want to point this out and I feel it is a great initiative and I feel that more", "959.26": "estates should do it and Tampines should expand this My Kind Fridge initiative.", "963.9": "So search about them online, they have a few news around and if you are around, you are", "969.1": "near a kind fridge and you are shopping for vegetables, buying chicken, why not do a little", "974.14": "bit more, right?", "975.98": "So, that is the three things that I feel you should include in your budget.", "980.46": "A book fund, exploration fund and a giving fund.", "984.7": "And with that, I hope you learned something

important thing to do is to watch our budget.", "197.92": "But that's not to say that being a little bit more penny pinching means you're going", "202.94": "to reduce your quality of life.", "205.5": "In the past, I remember when I was in school and I see people bring lunch boxes to school", "210.42": "and I'll judge them as like, hey, well, I was so...", "214.06": "You know no money to buy food, must pack food from home.", "217.82": "But now when I see people bring food to the office, I'll be like, oh my, you're so lucky", "222.34": "you managed to find time to do good food and bring a great lunch box to work.", "228.54": "So it's a mindset shift and it really depends on how you value different things.", "233.18": "And when I learned to value things like quality and health and many other different things", "239.78": "on other than just price, which I talk a little bit about.", "244.82": "One of the spending myths that we have today is that more expensive means better.", "249.64": "So yeah, backtrack to the episode on spending myths and to me that is like, oh, so terrible", "255.32": "because we don't factor in things like branding, we don't factor in things like rent, we don't", "260.16": "factor in things like, you know, many other different small elements that all these businesses", "265.32": "have to put in to command that price.", "268.32": "But many a times, if you're just looking at quality, you can do a lot of great things", "271.72": "on your own.", "273.08": "So yeah, don't be fooled by the whole idea of more expensive means better.", "277.64": "It really depends on how you value things and yeah, I personally believe that if you", "283.0": "go down to revalue the way we look at things, you come to a lot more emotional calm when", "288.76": "looking at different aspects of life.", "291.6": "And so when I look at this, I come to a question like, hmm, so how do I have fun in Singapore", "297.24": "then?", "298.24": "If everything is so expensive and I'm on a budget, how am I going to have fun?", "302.32": "So of course there are a lot of interesting places like the museum that you can go is", "306.24": "free.", "307.24": "National Arts Council gives free museum pass to everybody that's a Singaporean.", "311.24": "And there are a lot of activities out there that are free.", "314.6": "A lot of events going around and yeah, great places to go about.", "319.16": "But there are some things that you may not have thought about and I want to share with", "322.6": "you some things that I do, which I thought was really, really fun.", "325.4": "And the first thing I do is I'll join an interest group, a social community in fact, on meetup.com.", "332.9": "So I know I've talked about meetup.com and I want to share with you some of my experiences", "336.58": "on meetup.com.", "338.02": "So I've joined a few meetups and it's really, really fun.", "341.02": "One of the most memorable meetup that I've joined was this board game meetup group.", "346.5": "And what happened was I needed to pay $5 for a four-hour session at this board game place", "353.54": "in Marina South MRT station.", "358.82": "It's organised by an interest group where it's filled with board game lovers and it's", "363.14": "amazing because they all know how to play.", "365.5": "I was like one of the few noobs.", "367.34": "I knew nothing.", "368.34": "And I went there, all I did was pay $5 and I met like 40, 60 people.", "372.54": "They're all playing board games and many of them come as an individual.", "375.74": "And when I think about it, oh my goodness, it was very, very difficult to gather four", "380.3": "or five people to go to a board game cafe and play.", "383.26": "But on this meetup group, I managed to just pay a minimal, even cheaper than how I'll", "388.26": "usually pay at the board game cafe and be able to play all these different games with", "393.7": "all these different people that knew so much about board games and they taught me all these", "398.42": "different games and it was really fun.", "400.1": "So it was like a great social activity and it's a lot, very, very affordable.", "404.54": "And because it is an interest group, they're not profit-driven.", "407.3": "Although it is at a place which is a board game, which is kind of like a board game cafe,", "411.54": "more like a board game community area.", "414.62": "So it's kind of like a collaboration with that space and the interest group.", "419.22": "But because the interest group is not profit-driven, they managed to strike a deal with the board", "423.06": "game space owner.", "426.34": "And yeah, everyone was paying minimal to get maximum amount of joy.", "430.06": "I was like, wow, it's cool, man.", "431.7": "$5, I can do so.", "432.98": "I can have a great afternoon on the weekend, meet so many people and play board games.", "438.26": "I thought that was cool.", "440.02": "And there were a lot of other groups that I joined.", "442.66": "Some of the groups were ramen group.", "444.7": "So essentially, it's just a bunch of people that really love eating ramen and they go", "448.38": "out and have fun together by eating ramen, go to different places and have ramen together.", "452.9": "I was like, hey, it's pretty nice, man.", "454.98": "Yeah, I just get to try different, different ramen.", "457.94": "It's not exactly cheap, cheap per se, but there's a lot of social activity around and", "462.66": "you don't need to spend a lot of money.", "464.22": "Just over a bowl of ramen, people chat about all sorts of stuff.", "468.22": "And on meetup.com, I think there are a lot of interesting groups.", "471.58": "I saw one that was about social dancing and there was another one about language.", "475.86": "You could gather with a bunch of people that are interested in Japanese lessons, learning", "480.78": "Japanese and just have fun together, talk, speak in Japanese and be able to use that", "488.5": "language that you're interested in.", "490.18": "So to me, it's like, wow, I don't need to spend much money because all these interest", "494.06": "groups are not profit driven.", "496.22": "They are interest driven.", "497.22": "They're just trying to gather people that are interested on the same thing to come together", "500.66": "and have fun, connect and be better together.", "503.74": "So on a budget, wow, great stuff.", "506.34": "Five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars, nothing much.", "508.74": "And you can do great things on the weekend.", "510.42": "So why not pick up the app meetup.com, join the interest group and have fun.", "515.5": "Go and do it.", "516.5": "And let me know if you found any interesting things on the app or join any interesting", "520.88": "social groups that I could then recommend to friends and family and maybe some of you", "525.1": "guys here too.", "526.9": "And the next point that I feel many people have not used a lot is to make use of public",

it gets a little warm.", "544.7": "So yeah, I get it.", "546.9": "But have you thought of picnicking during the evening?", "550.54": "There's a lot of media that shows you that you need to picnic early in the morning, everyone", "556.1": "wakes up early in the morning, go for a picnic.", "558.54": "And I was like, oh my goodness, in Singapore you don't do that because if you meet up at",

have fun.", "580.7": "The Botanical Gardens is beautiful, McRitchie, it's very nice.", "584.3": "We have a lot of public spaces around that are beautifully done, so why not make use", "589.74": "of it?", "590.74": "And if the circumstances doesn't allow you to go out in the morning, then go out in the", "594.46": "evening.", "595.46": "Nobody says that you cannot go picnic in the evening, nobody says you cannot go for a stroll", "598.9": "in the evening if you're trying to avoid the sun.", "602.34": "So we have great beaches, we have great parks and I feel extremely underutilised.", "607.9": "When I ask my friends, hey, you want to go to the beach or you want to go to the parks", "611.5": "or you want to go to the gardens, many people will be like, are you sure?", "615.86": "So boring.", "617.42": "But when I look at it, all these are just great places to hang out and connect.", "622.42": "I don't need to do another activity just to...", "625.22": "I don't need to go to a cafe or go to a movie.", "630.34": "Once in a while I do that, but it's not like an every week thing.", "632.66": "I'm amazed how people go for cafe hops.", "637.7": "One afternoon they do three, four cafes.", "639.66": "I'm like, are you serious?", "640.66": "You're going to spend a ton and most of these cafes, they suck.", "645.06": "They don't make great coffee, they don't make great pastry, many things are outsourced.", "649.34": "I will do an episode to share with you more about why I don't think you should go to a", "652.9": "cafe and why you shouldn't start a cafe, but that's in a later stage.", "657.52": "So yeah, make use of public spaces.", "659.02": "Go to the library, go to the parks, go to the beach.", "661.82": "In some way you are paying for it because you pay taxes.", "665.5": "But in many other ways, it's kind of free.", "667.3": "Since you already paid taxes for it, why not use it?", "669.74": "It's great stuff.", "670.74": "If you're on a budget, you can still do a lot of things.", "673.74": "And actually many of these interest groups make use of public spaces.", "677.22": "So yeah, other than joining an interest group, other than making use of public spaces, one", "681.74": "thing you could do, which I feel we've not been doing a lot, is to potluck at your friend's", "685.82": "place.", "686.82": "Yeah, to me it's like, it used to be a thing.", "689.22": "I don't know about you, but when I was younger, we would always hang out at my friend's place,", "692.7": "different friends.", "694.7": "School days, right?", "696.38": "After exams, we would just stay overnight at one of my friend's place, play games, play", "701.02": "mahjong, sing song overnight, whatever, do all sorts of random things.", "705.66": "And it feels as if as we grow older, we stop hanging out at our friend's place.", "710.7": "It feels like we need to go out there and find a place together.", "714.9": "And to me it's like, oh, why not just go to a friend's place?", "718.94": "It's great, right?", "719.94": "We have had great experiences doing that.", "721.78": "It makes things really affordable.", "723.66": "You don't need to pay for all the premium outside because of space, and just hang out", "727.42": "and chill, and you can be all shabby and simple and basic and just hang around.", "734.02": "So I've been actively trying to do that more.", "736.98": "And yeah, it's really, really nice.", "738.1": "I always try to get my friends to come over to my place and try to get them to open up", "742.54": "their space for us together.", "745.66": "Some people, like when I'm a host, I will make sure I tell my friends that you can come", "749.78": "over, feel free.", "750.78": "I love having you coming over.", "752.82": "I have great tea.", "753.82": "You don't need to go out there and spend a lot of money on very terrible teas that have", "758.54": "aroma oils, spices to make the tea taste better.", "762.74": "I have a lot of good teas at home.", "764.54": "You should come to my place to drink.", "766.26": "But if you come to my place to drink, you've got to help me to clean up.", "769.74": "Let's say we're going to cook at my place.", "772.34": "You're going to do a party at my place.", "774.74": "You've got to help me to clean up.", "776.34": "If not, that will be the last time.", "778.22": "So I make it really clear that as a host, I gladly welcome you.", "781.94": "Because I stay alone, I don't want to clean up everything on my own.", "786.14": "So if you want to come to my place, cool stuff, come.", "788.14": "I love it.", "789.14": "But we've got to clean up together.", "790.42": "So if you're a host, make it clear to your friends that, hey, my mom's home or my parents", "795.54": "are home.", "796.54": "So after a certain time, we've got to be a little bit quieter.", "798.18": "We've got to clean up the place.", "799.94": "Or if you're a guest, then yeah, why not just help out with your friends?", "805.14": "I think it's great fun, great childhood fun, having a potluck at a friend's place, having", "809.14": "a gathering at a friend's place, bringing some beer over at a friend's place.", "813.14": "It's like we've forgotten that many a times we are just trying to find the next space", "817.74": "when actually we can just go to our friend's place and hang out or come to my place if", "821.74": "you're my friend.", "822.74": "So, yeah, I hope you get a good idea that actually you can have a lot of fun on a budget.", "828.14": "Because if you think about it, we've done it for a really long time.", "830.54": "When we were younger, we were always having fun on a budget.", "833.14": "When you're young in school, you're always on a budget.", "836.04": "So why not continue to do that?", "837.86": "We don't need to escalate our lifestyle just because we have more money.", "842.86": "In actuality, I'm not sure if that's really escalating because going to the cafe and paying", "847.46": "that kind of premium for something that is not nice, and you've got to dress up and stuff,", "852.26": "I mean, it depends on your priority.", "854.26": "But when I look at it, you can always join an interest group, you can always make use", "859.38": "of public spaces, and you can always hang out at your friend's place, have a potluck,", "863.1": "do something, hang out at your friend's place.",

just got a job, you have some excess money, you want to be smart of your savings.", "122.32": "Yeah.", "123.32": "By the same time, because you're new, you start making some money, you're easily tempted.", "127.64": "You want to buy this thing, you want to do that thing.", "130.6": "And yeah, it's very normal because you just started making money and you want to be able", "135.56": "to use it.", "136.56": "So it's nice.", "137.92": "And then on the other end, there are some people that are so afraid to spend and they", "143.16": "have a very unhealthy relationship with their money and it pains them when they save but", "148.84": "they still save.", "149.84": "So I have a friend who told me recently, he's like, you know, I really try to save but every", "154.32": "time I save, my heart cringes.", "156.04": "It's like, oh, it's so painful.", "158.12": "I just keep saving and it affects my quality of life.", "161.6": "So she has saved to a level where it affects her quality of life.", "164.92": "That means she's not comfortable with whatever she's doing.", "168.16": "And to me, that is very unhealthy as well.", "170.72": "So how do we reach a point where we are healthily saving money and working towards our goal", "177.28": "but at the same time, taking care of ourselves?", "179.92": "I think that is where we are looking at.", "182.88": "And definitely, it's not easy.", "184.92": "It takes time to be able to figure out what actually fits my life, what is something that", "189.76": "I appreciate.", "190.76": "It's not all just about cutting back expenses when

"240.12": "How do you become a smart saver?", "242.8": "And the first thing that I'm going to share with you is to automate your savings contribution.", "249.12": "Save before you spend.", "250.72": "This is extremely important.", "252.28": "I know in Singapore, there's this shop and save.", "254.68": "I used to have this supermarket called shop and save.", "257.64": "But if you think about it, if you shop, you're not actually saving, you're shopping.", "262.56": "What you need to do is save and shop, right?", "265.8": "You want to be able to commit to your savings goal or any of these other big ticket purchases", "271.88": "whether it's your further development fund or whether it's your mortgage fund, right", "276.36": "from the beginning, right from the start.", "278.08": "So every month when the money comes into your paycheck bank account, you want to be able", "282.92": "to automatically transfer all these money to your savings account or to your various", "287.88": "funds accounts.", "289.44": "So that is not difficult these days because it's getting really easy to set auto transfers.", "294.56": "The banking back ends are a lot easier.", "297.64": "So do it.", "298.64": "Automated transfers will help you to stay committed to whatever you want to do.", "303.2": "So if you want to save money, go and open a new bank account and set that as a savings", "307.84": "account and create an auto transfer from your paycheck account.", "311.84": "I think that is cool.", "312.84": "And one extra tip I'm going to give it to you is that I personally use Maybank for my", "318.52": "savings account.", "320.44": "I'm going to show you why it's really cute.", "322.4": "Because if you think about it, it's very tough to find a Maybank account, right?", "325.48": "Really really tough to find a Maybank outlet in Singapore.", "330.08": "There are only a few of them, one in Chinatown, one in Raffles Place, you know, in the heartlands", "335.12": "it's very difficult to find them.", "337.0": "So it makes it tougher for me to go and withdraw money from Maybank.", "342.68": "So to me, I think that it was a good shot back then when many things were operating", "347.28": "in cash.", "348.28": "But I still use this strategy because I want to make it difficult for me to touch my savings.", "353.84": "I don't want to make it so simple.", "354.92": "If I open a POSB account or a DBS account just for savings, chances are they have easy", "359.64": "access all across the island.", "361.2": "I could easily get money with that card.", "363.84": "And to me, that is just making it difficult for me to save when I could just take a bank", "371.56": "that is very scarce in terms of the outreach for money.", "376.08": "And then I'll be like, hey, okay, Maybank, right?", "378.88": "Very difficult for me to draw money.", "380.48": "Cool stuff.", "381.48": "I'm going to make it easier for me to save.", "383.48": "Which brings me to my second point, is

some sort of context.", "95.04": "Because the basics here is that budget travel, it's about getting the most for the least", "100.32": "that you spend.", "101.32": "And to be fair, actually even people who have spent a lot of money, they also want to get", "105.44": "the most out of what they spend.", "107.96": "It's just about how do you then see what do you want?", "112.04": "What do you value?", "113.44": "So I think that's kind of where things are.", "116.44": "But okay, let's just go simple and just the idea of budget travelling where you spend", "120.64": "the least, try to get a lot.", "122.92": "And of course, the standard culprits are there, travel off-season, travel longer.", "128.36": "Because those are like, you amortize, right?", "130.68": "Essentially, if you travel for one week, your air ticket, you divide by seven days, that", "134.6": "is the cost of travelling.", "135.6": "But if you travel a month, then the air ticket divided by 30 days, your per day ticket price", "140.24": "is a lot lower.", "141.32": "So those are the usual culprit.", "143.24": "You can use your mouse, don't stay hotel, stay Airbnb.", "149.88": "Pretty much those are the standard

with you today.", "177.16": "Okay, but before I begin sharing with you my tips and tricks and ideas, I must establish", "184.8": "my legitimacy that I actually know how to do these things.", "188.04": "So this is my passport.", "189.68": "I'm just looking through and I have been to 2019, May, I've been to Japan.", "195.56": "Of course, frequent Malaysian travel.", "198.0": "I was staying in

Georgia recently.", "210.2": "This is my Istanbul check-in.", "213.32": "So yeah, for all of you that are listening in through audio, then you cannot tell that", "218.28": "I'm flipping through my passport.", "219.28": "Okay, but the idea here is I'm trying to establish that I know my shit.", "222.8": "I've been traveling around and I have tried many different ideas and I've kind of just", "227.48": "think of all these things a little bit better.", "229.28": "How do I squeeze the most out of my money?", "233.24": "So barring aside traveling long-term, that means you're going to just be on the road,", "237.2": "you're going to travel and have fun and work along the way.", "239.92": "Barring aside all those things, these are some of the ideas that I have.", "243.76": "And it brings me to point number one.", "246.88": "And point number one is to watch out for airport taxes.", "251.28": "Okay, a lot of people tell you travel off-season, travel budget, use miles, all that aside.", "256.44": "But just a very basic idea that if you travel out from Singapore's airport, there is quite", "262.64": "a heavy airport tax as compared to if you fly from Johor.", "267.36": "You don't believe me, you go and try.", "268.92": "I've talked to a lot of friends about this thing.", "271.88": "Instead of flying out from Singapore, which a lot of people maybe stay in the West, stay", "275.84": "in the North, then they come all the way to Changi to fly out of, which okay, to be fair,", "279.84": "there are a lot of options.", "281.2": "But if some of the places you are trying to fly to, let's say Guangzhou, some of the other", "284.68": "places that I cannot remember exactly where, but Johor does provide.", "288.2": "I think Bangkok, the airport has a few of these kind of airlines, at least these kind of routes.", "294.28": "So if you stay in Woodlands, Jurong, all those places, actually you can consider taking a", "298.6": "day trip to Johor and just take this as a way of travelling.", "303.44": "Because when you do that, actually save a lot of money from flights.", "306.8": "Go and take a look at Johor.", "308.88": "Another data point I've gathered is recently I'm planning my trip to London.", "313.52": "So flying into London from KL's airport is not that expensive, right?", "318.72": "It's cheaper, a few hundred dollars.", "320.28": "But flying out of London directly is very expensive.", "323.8": "Of course, I've done some Googling here and there, and you realise that all these hub", "327.6": "places, right, whether it's Dubai, whether it's London, Singapore, Hong Kong, all these", "331.4": "airport hubs, they make money from the airport.", "333.8": "And how do they do that?", "334.8": "Airport taxes.", "336.24": "So after a while, I've learned to be able to plan my trip and take that travel as part", "341.98": "of the trip itself.", "343.48": "So going to Johor one day, then I fly out from Johor.", "346.76": "Let's say my plan this time round is to fly from KL to London.", "351.8": "This is my July trip, KL to London.", "353.76": "And from London, I'm going to move all the way down to Barcelona.", "356.52": "And then from Barcelona, I'm going to fly out.", "358.4": "So some people will be like, oh, this is so tiring, got to move around so much.", "361.88": "So okay, on average, maybe two weeks, three weeks trip, these kind of things make a lot", "366.4": "of sense.", "367.4": "So you kind of plan your route along with this idea that, oh, I can save a few hundred", "373.02": "dollars just to fly out of a particular airport.", "375.98": "And you can always make the trip a fun trip.", "378.66": "Don't think of travel as this, like, oh, I'm going to get from one spot to the next spot", "382.98": "to the next spot.", "383.98": "And definitely, you'll feel very tired.", "385.94": "And it doesn't help that there's a lot of travel agency in the past that make you do", "389.86": "that, right?", "390.86": "You hop on the bus, you go to the next stop.", "391.86": "It's very irritating, very annoying.", "393.46": "But if you think of this as a way of moving from point to point, as part of the travel,", "399.92": "as part of the journey, as part of experiencing new things, then this idea of, oh, maybe I", "404.72": "can move to another airport that's a little bit cheaper, you know, it's not that much", "408.92": "of a problem anymore.", "410.72": "And of course, some cities have multiple airports, so you can check all of their routes.", "415.32": "Just watch out for airport taxes.", "416.84": "Rule of thumb, air hubs always very expensive because that's the way they make money.", "423.04": "Which brings me to point number two, and that is to stay further away from the city center.", "429.34": "It's very intuitive and it's like, do I really want to do that?", "432.82": "I'm going to expand.", "433.82": "I'm going to expand this idea after a word from our sponsor.", "442.18": "So okay, I'm not like some kampung traveler.", "446.14": "I always go to the kampung, I always go to the outskirts of the city.", "450.3": "I'm a big fan of living in like slightly more outside because it's quieter.", "455.42": "You get to see more of the local life.", "457.66": "You get to experience the way of life of the local people.", "461.72": "Like a lot of people travel to Bangkok, okay, very common, but how many of you actually", "466.36": "been to this place called Talaplu?", "468.16": "Right, so I stayed there because my friend was staying.", "471.36": "I was sort of bunking with a friend.", "472.36": "Of course, that's another tip, right?", "474.22": "Have a lot of friends and bunk in with them.", "476.44": "You save a lot of money on lodging.", "478.36": "Thank you, friends.", "481.36": "That aside, because I did that, I get to experience the life of the local.", "485.7": "Apparently, Talaplu, which is a place in Bangkok, was where the Cantonese people and the Hokkien", "491.46": "people, essentially the Chinese people, when they first landed in Thailand, that's one", "495.3": "of the big places where they gathered.", "497.54": "So when you go there, you can still hear Cantonese, Hokkien, you know, just some dialect.", "501.94": "A lot of old people there are still speaking in that way.", "504.98": "It's very interesting.", "505.98": "It's like a Chinatown.", "506.98": "There are a few streets, a lot of food around.", "509.78": "It just feels super, super local.", "511.9": "Some of the best kueh shop, the best wonton mee shop I had in Bangkok itself is there.", "518.16": "So go and check that out.", "519.16": "Check that out.", "520.16": "It's an interesting, fun place.", "521.16": "But the idea here is first you need to understand how tourist places are developed and how do", "527.56": "they come about.", "528.56": "Barring aside all those big capital injection right from the get-go like your Disneyland", "533.76": "or in China, they have all these very ugly touristy spots that are like out in the weird", "539.62": "mountains and then you have to drive all the way there.", "541.98": "You go there and very cheesy, very old school.", "543.82": "Nobody goes there anymore.", "544.82": "Barring aside all those spots that are specifically made for tourism, most other tourist spots", "551.26": "like your Osaka walking shopping street or your Jonker street or even Chinatown in Singapore,", "557.7": "they all started as a place where the locals will go to.", "561.66": "So they were interesting, they were fun, the locals go there, a lot of people go there.", "565.3": "So other tourists start to come in, right?", "566.96": "So this is where all the locals hang out, everybody go there.", "570.0": "And then what's the next step?", "571.0": "The next step is money will come in.", "574.36": "Capital will start to come in to capitalize on this place, right?", "577.44": "So that they can open their shops, sell to the tourists because the tourists will give", "581.72": "them a bigger margin, blah, blah, blah.", "583.44": "And then it will squeeze out all these smaller merchants, right?", "586.16": "Because they cannot afford on the main street now.", "588.6": "So what happens?", "589.6": "They will shift to the sides of the streets or even further out.", "593.16": "But the fun part lies here.", "594.6": "The fun part is if you only go to the main tourist street, you will not be able to see", "600.06": "where the original merchants are.", "601.5": "Try to go to the left, to the right, go to the side streets that are around the area.", "605.22": "They tend to hover around the same place because they want to cater to the same crowd that", "609.34": "they've always catered to but they cannot afford the rent in pretty much the prime street", "614.3": "where they started.", "615.46": "So go to the side streets, you'll see a lot of local stuff, very fun, very interesting.", "620.22": "And why do I put it that way, right?", "622.16": "So when you understand how capital comes into, capitalise on this kind of tourist destination,", "627.64": "then you start to realise that at some point, the whole touristy area is built for tourists,", "633.16": "like Istanbul.", "634.16": "So if you go to Istanbul and you stay where the big mosque is, the Blue Mosque, you stay", "639.36": "where the Constantinople Wall is, everywhere is extremely touristy.", "643.8": "The Grand Bazaar, blah, blah, blah.", "646.6": "Honestly, as someone that travels frequently and is trying to go there and understand local", "651.22": "culture and understand how people live, what is it like here, it's horrible.", "657.5": "Touristy spots are horrible.", "658.5": "I know it's very convenient, you go down there, you get all these things but they are all", "662.18": "very artificial and is that really the kind of travel experience that you want?", "667.14": "Like I said, back to the point number one, which is travel can be part of your plan.", "671.5": "And I know a lot of people are very annoyed because every morning, I work, I shower, I", "677.3": "carry my bag, 7, 8am, I go on the MRT, I get to my workplace, I'm done, I come back.", "682.32": "So a lot of people have this annoyance about travelling but if you move around in a new", "686.44": "place, that's actually very fun, very interesting.", "689.52": "You're seeing all these, wow, what's that, what's that, what's that.", "692.32": "So there's a lot of things to discover on the go.", "695.68": "Do not let the jadedness that you have in your routine in your current life affect the", "700.4": "way you travel.", "702.66": "So big fan of staying in the outskirts of the city, especially when I was in Osaka.", "707.74": "I did stay in the prime area, in the middle of the city but after a while, I was like,", "712.06": "you know, and then I went all the way out nearer to this other shrine, I can't remember", "716.18": "the name but that was when I felt the way of the life of the locals.", "721.74": "And I would say for more of you, if you're listening in, please try to travel and please", "727.5": "try to live in the outskirts.", "729.14": "It's definitely more affordable, more fun, more interesting.", "732.32": "What I just wanted to tell you was to think about how capital then takes over touristy", "735.92": "spots and how if you want to enjoy a different way of life and try to understand the local", "741.08": "way of life, then you got to go out.", "742.68": "Go where the locals are, okay.", "745.2": "I've given you a few good spots to travel, they're all very affordable.", "748.32": "So check them out.", "750.92": "Which brings me to point number three on how do you get the most budget, most bang out", "756.0": "of your budget when you're travelling, that is to plan your days with multiple combination.", "762.74": "What does that mean?", "763.74": "A lot of times we travel, when I first started, of course I travelled in a group, friends,", "768.9": "bunch of us, we went and then after that I started travelling alone and I felt like,", "772.54": "oh, travelling alone is quite fun because I could just focus on myself, I do what I", "776.42": "want to do, I don't really need to care about whether my friend wants to go here.", "779.94": "But eventually it became a little bit more problematic in the sense of, I'm limited as", "784.68": "to the places that I can stay because if you stay alone, if you want to take the whole", "787.48": "apartment, it's very expensive.", "790.48": "And I'm also limited by the kind of dining options and the kind of activity options that", "794.32": "I can do.", "795.32": "Honestly, why would you want to go to a place and be like, you know, selfie on your own,", "798.8": "a bit lame.", "799.8": "So a lot of people take photos because it's a group, there's a memorial in it, you know,", "803.32": "but okay, if you want to take on your own, fine, do it, I'm not judging you.", "806.44": "But what I found out eventually as I've travelled to many places is you can travel as a group", "811.56": "but do not be stuck within the group.", "813.98": "So travel as a group plan, four of you can go on a trip together, share the apartment,", "818.34": "great, do your thing.", "819.74": "But you should have that one or two days of your own, right, or maybe one or two days", "823.7": "just you, okay, either can be a split up, three people, one people, or even you can", "828.1": "meet local people, right, and that's a great way, great fun, meetup.com, you know, go to", "832.66": "the local communities, there are a lot of ways to go about doing that, Facebook.", "836.26": "I think Facebook is still one of the most amazing places to kind of meet a bunch of", "839.78": "people, right.", "841.12": "So the idea here is instead of definitely travelling alone or travelling with your partner", "846.4": "or travelling as a group, what you can do is to kind of merge them together with the", "851.16": "core spine when you travel, right.", "853.12": "So seven days, 12 days, 15 days, when you guys travel, there's a core spine, what are", "857.96": "we going to do, what are we going to do, what are we going to do, what do we want to achieve.", "860.78": "And then in between, you can always do your own thing, right.", "863.96": "So it could just be like, oh, today we're going to have breakfast together, after that", "866.28": "do your thing, go to your library, do what you want to do, go and hipster, you know,", "870.14": "go and visit.", "871.14": "Like for me, I'm becoming a big fan of visiting universities and I'm going to try to interview", "874.66": "some of these university professors with leading ideas, right.", "877.26": "So yeah, it becomes a very interesting way of getting the most out of the budget because", "884.58": "firstly you're safe on renter because you're not renting alone, you get the freedom to", "889.22": "move around on your own whenever you want to, and also you can dine as a group which", "894.82": "gives you more options and more activities to choose from as a group.", "899.66": "So I think there is value in travelling as a collective without being bound to the collective,", "905.36": "right.", "906.36": "So chill with a few friends, you know, go and travel together but don't have to everything", "911.08": "do together.", "912.08": "I think that's a big part of how I look at it these days.", "915.2": "Of course, of course, travelling with friends can be very scary, can break relationships.", "921.28": "So my biggest recommendation to all of you is to try to travel to Melaka, right.", "926.64": "Go somewhere near, somewhere affordable, test out the friend, right, test out whether", "931.18": "you can actually travel together.", "933.66": "Some friends can hang out together, have a good drink, have a good laugh, play sports", "937.14": "but doesn't mean you can live in the same apartment for 20 days together or 15 days", "941.26": "or 7 days together, right.", "944.06": "So if you are testing out some friends, great, Melaka is always my top choice.", "948.62": "Go there, have a good time and then eventually when you feel more confident with that, you", "952.36": "can go further and travel further and travel as a group, multiple permutation, great, great,", "958.44": "great value for your budget.", "960.24": "Okay, so yeah, simple episode today.", "963.64": "I just wanted to share with you my tips and thoughts because firstly, I'm moving around", "967.4": "and secondly, I see a lot of people trying to move around.", "969.64": "So barring aside all your travel off season, Airbnb, all those stuff which a lot of people", "974.16": "talk about, these are the three pointers that I have for you to get the best of your buck", "978.16": "when you're travelling.", "979.46": "Number one is to watch out for airport taxes.", "981.62": "A lot of air hubs, very convenient to travel to but they usually charge you a lot and when", "986.22": "you fly in, it's fine because they're not taxing you to fly in.", "989.42": "When you fly out, it's a bit more expensive.", "992.74": "So what I tend to do is I fly into the air hub and then I'll try to find another way", "997.54": "to get back to where I started.", "999.94": "So that's great.", "1000.94": "A lot of nomads do that also and they move around but yeah, because you're not a nomadic,", "1004.02": "you just want to do a two-week trip, just watch out for airport taxes.", "1006.8": "Try to make that journey into a cheaper airport part of the journey.", "1012.04": "It is quite fun.", "1013.56": "Number two is to stay further away from the city.", "1017.12": "Of course, a lot of people have this annoyance, oh yeah, if I stay far away from the city,", "1021.72": "I got to move in and out.", "1022.72": "But hey, if you're travelling, you're having fun, the movement about is an experience in", "1028.04": "itself.", "1029.04": "And also, you don't need every day stay out of the city.", "1031.12": "You can stay two or three days within the city, get talk, talk, talk as a tourist and", "1034.98": "then you move out and go and experience life of the local.", "1038.94": "I think that's great value, great cultural insights.", "1042.06": "You get to see more things and everything is local price.", "1044.86": "It's much, much more affordable, like way more affordable.", "1048.3": "I just came from Turkey.", "1050.26": "In the heart of Istanbul where Constantinople is, it's easily two to three times, in fact,", "1056.18": "maybe three to four times the price of what I pay for the same thing in the local areas", "1061.04": "which eventually I spend a lot of time in.", "1063.32": "So yeah, think about that.", "1065.04": "And number three is plan your days with a multiple permutation in mind.", "1070.92": "So travel as a group definitely saves you an apartment.", "1073.56": "Eating together definitely gives you more options and activities.", "1075.92": "But sometimes you want your own time, you want your own experience.", "1078.96": "You just want to go to this library, then all your friends want to go, they want to", "1082.2": "go somewhere else.", "1083.2": "It's fine, go on your own, separate it out.", "1084.92": "So instead of saying, I have to solo travel or I have to go in a pair, I have to go in", "1087.96": "a group, you can always have multiple permutation as you move along.", "1092.02": "This gives you a lot of bang for your buck while meeting all the needs that you have", "1095.58": "that other people may not have.", "1098.54": "So with that, I hope you learn something useful today and have a great trip, right?", "1101.62": "Go and have some fun.", "1102.62": "I think two years of pandemic, very stressed.", "1104.86": "Go out, enjoy yourself, watch your budget, have a good time.", "1108.1": "I hope you learn

"So, I'm seeing a lot of those things online and I thought I will chime in and add my viewpoint", "1211.66": "on it, right?", "1212.66": "So, some financial advice from boomers are great, good stuff, right?", "1217.42": "But there are many that have been taken out of context or the context have changed.", "1221.98": "So, when the context have changed and you don't keep up, it becomes very problematic.", "1226.02": "So, next week's episode, next two weeks episode or maybe even three weeks depending on how", "1230.74": "much I can get out of this.", "1232.96": "So, next two weeks at least, Toxic Boomer Financial Advice.", "1236.8": "I've consolidated some of these thoughts and I hope you find them useful.", "1239.92": "So meanwhile, go have fun first, travel, do your thing and I

buy", "130.44": "or their no buy project on YouTube.", "132.28": "And so I thought, it's like two birds with one stone, right?", "135.52": "I want to share my progress with this project.", "139.56": "And then it was also something for me to do on the side,", "142.0": "outside of work.", "143.96": "And yeah, so I started the YouTube channel.", "147.2": "There were different options, right?", "148.04": "So I could have done a blog,", "148.88": "I could have done a YouTube channel,", "149.72": "but it felt like a lot of the people I was watching", "151.36": "was on YouTube.", "152.2": "And I wanted to do a bit of video editing,", "154.72": "see what I can learn from the work of producing a video,", "158.6": "which is why I went with YouTube.", "161.0": "And as for the content of the channel,", "162.88": "I meant for it to be,", "164.44": "and I still mean for it to be like a video journal", "166.68": "of my journey with adulting and all the work", "171.56": "that is involved, like from managing personal finance", "174.36": "to housing, what it's like to, in my case,", "178.36": "live in a HDB flat and manage the HDB flat.", "180.88": "I also wanted to go into things like

the overall plan for the channel.", "194.44": "Yeah, the main series on my channel is the money diaries,", "197.0": "which is like a month by month recap", "199.04": "of how the low buyer is going.", "200.8": "And I literally just tell everybody", "202.08": "what I've bought for the month.", "204.48": "And also my channel name is Adulting in Singapore, right?", "207.72": "So I thought the including that Singapore", "209.72": "was quite important because it contextualizes", "212.32": "everything that I'm talking about.", "213.84": "It's a bit clunky, like the whole channel name,", "216.68": "Lisa's Adulting in Singapore, but it's stuck.", "218.6": "And when I thought about it, it's stuck.", "220.0": "And yeah, I think for now that is the name I wanna go with.", "223.6": "It makes sense.", "224.44": "I mean, adulting is a phrase", "226.2": "that's been talked about in recent years", "227.76": "and on your channel, we don't get to see your face.", "231.08": "So it's actually, it does read like a blog", "233.72": "because you've written the script, you structure it,", "237.12": "and then you present it, but your face is behind the camera.", "240.16": "So if you're watching this on YouTube right now,", "241.56": "this could be the first time that Lisa has revealed her face", "245.92": "on the internet and all that.", "248.16": "So adulting in Singapore, first, how do you define adulting?", "251.68": "And since we're on the financial coconut,", "253.56": "you can define it in relation to money,", "255.52": "of course, other aspects as well.", "256.76": "And what are your first few steps to adulting?", "259.2": "How do you get started in adulting?", "261.12": "I guess if you look online,", "262.52": "the definition is something like the assumption of tasks,", "266.72": "responsibilities, or behaviors that you associate", "270.16": "with what a mature grownup or adult will do.", "273.96": "For myself, if I think working backwards", "276.36": "with your questions, like how do I,", "277.92": "what are the first steps to adulting?", "280.2": "When did you first like, okay, I'm adulting.", "282.68": "Now I'm an adult and I have adult responsibilities.", "285.24": "I think it comes with, and the realization can happen", "287.8": "at any point of your life, right?", "289.68": "It's not really tied to an age, like when you graduate,", "290.88": "although that's when it happens for most people.", "293.36": "You come to the realization that you are responsible", "296.6": "for your own life and for sustaining that life.", "299.2": "And it can also come together with realizing", "301.28": "that you might be responsible for someone else's life.", "303.64": "It could be your parents.", "305.32": "It could be your children, if you're in that stage already.", "308.76": "So it's like understanding that you have that burden", "311.92": "of responsibility on you, and then taking steps", "314.88": "to do the things that would help you support", "319.68": "and sustain that life.", "320.76": "A big part of it is knowing for yourself", "323.08": "that you cannot really live", "324.24": "in the blissful ignorance anymore.", "327.28": "And I think many associate adulting", "329.68": "with very straightforward, like financial related tasks", "332.88": "or like knowing what phone plan to choose", "335.2": "or understanding CPF or knowing what the heck are taxes", "338.24": "and how much you have to pay.", "339.64": "And these are for sure like the low hanging fruit", "342.04": "of things that you should ideally seek to know more about,", "346.56": "not for its own sake, but because these are things", "349.12": "that you have to do in the context of the society", "352.44": "that you are in.", "353.28": "It's part of you having to be, part of you wanting", "356.84": "to be a functional member of society in the context", "359.84": "of the place that you live in.", "362.04": "And so this can differ from place to place.", "365.0": "Yeah, were there any skills that you have to pick up?", "366.92": "How did you get started?", "368.28": "When did you realize that, okay.", "369.48": "For myself, I think the financial management came", "373.0": "before the concrete realization", "375.2": "that I have to be the adult now.", "377.28": "And that was when I was in JC,", "379.68": "I, for the first time, I got my own money", "382.92": "through a scholarship when I was in school.", "384.76": "So that wasn't money that I got from my parents", "386.96": "as allowance, that was money that was mine.", "389.64": "So that was the first time I thought,", "390.96": "okay, I have to manage this somehow.", "392.96": "And then I was 16 at the time,", "394.2": "which is when you can get an ATM card.", "395.96": "So that's when I started tracking what I was spending on.", "399.56": "And a lot of it was like food and whatever other things", "402.44": "that I could buy online.", "404.2": "Of course, at that time, I didn't know about investing.", "406.4": "I didn't know about any sort of budgeting framework.", "408.88": "All I knew was that I needed to write down", "411.16": "what I was spending on and also how much money I had left.", "414.76": "So that was the very, very foundation.", "417.2": "And then that feeling of adulting,", "419.64": "which is also about maturity, right?", "422.88": "And not just about the things that you do,", "424.4": "but your relationships with people", "426.12": "and how you treat them and how you are around them.", "429.08": "That maturing is part of the adulting journey, I think.", "432.8": "So that came to me much later after I graduated,", "436.04": "when I had to start supporting my family.", "438.48": "And I knew that I needed to carry myself in a certain way", "441.4": "and make decisions in a certain way", "442.92": "that is influenced by my circumstances", "445.44": "and wanting to have the best possible situation for them", "448.72": "with whatever resources we had to work with.", "450.88": "You definitely started relatively younger.", "453.0": "You're already tracking your expenses at the age of 16.", "455.88": "I mean, well, I wasn't doing that for sure at 16.", "459.28": "I was still getting pocket money, spending with it,", "461.92": "but I didn't know where the money was going.", "463.76": "So it started relatively young.", "465.32": "And then you mentioned that as you grew up,", "467.96": "you have to also take care of some responsibilities at home.", "471.88": "Could you share a bit about that?", "473.36": "Right, and give us an idea of what that is like.", "477.2": "When I was in my final semester, my father passed away.", "481.08": "So he was the primary breadwinner", "483.88": "and manager of the household in that sense.", "487.76": "So after he passed away, I am the oldest in the family.", "491.56": "So I took over because my mother is not educated", "495.24": "and she's also not Singaporean.", "497.52": "So there were a lot of things that I had to learn.", "500.0": "The worst case scenario is of course,", "501.76": "she cannot stay in the country.", "502.88": "So that was my perspective.", "504.44": "How do I keep her here with my family so that we...", "508.16": "Can stay together as a family unit, right?", "511.04": "And how, at the time we were staying with my father's sister.", "515.6": "So in terms of having a roof over our heads,", "517.56": "having food on the table,", "518.92": "that wasn't really the issue immediately.", "521.88": "And so I was kind of shielded from that also.", "524.24": "So I assumed responsibility, but I think only in name", "528.48": "with the understanding that, okay,", "529.88": "the responsibilities maybe will come later", "532.04": "in terms of the actual work that I have to do.", "533.72": "And it did come later.", "534.64": "It came in 2020 when I made a decision to move my family out.", "538.6": "And so from there,", "539.84": "I had already been working for about six months.", "542.16": "I was also at the time reading a lot about personal finance.", "545.92": "Now that I had an income, now that I had a family to support,", "548.44": "I was wondering what is the best way to work with what I had", "552.0": "to support my mother.", "553.56": "And at the time also my brother was just finishing up", "556.64": "his junior college.", "557.76": "And then from there, it's just like a ongoing list", "560.68": "of things that I am learning about and executing.", "564.24": "So having to buy the house, that was a big thing.", "566.52": "And I did it at my...", "567.4": "I had to do that by myself because I was...", "569.8": "My mother couldn't buy a house, obviously.", "571.6": "And I'm the one with the job.", "573.76": "And then after getting the house,", "575.36": "okay, how do I make the house livable?", "577.2": "How do I renovate it?", "578.68": "And then what electricity retailer do I go with?", "581.56": "I mean, even before the house,", "582.88": "I was reading up on investing and,", "585.88": "oh, what the heck are ETFs and unit trust?", "587.8": "And where do I put my money?", "589.28": "What is trustworthy?", "590.36": "It's just an ongoing list of things", "591.8": "that you move forward to learn about", "594.16": "because with knowledge comes power to make educated", "598.0": "and intentional decisions.", "600.0": "So I was just absorbing everything that I could,", "602.64": "learning everything that I could", "604.0": "in order to live what I thought was", "606.6": "the best life within my means right now.", "609.16": "So the situation with your mom and the passing of a dad,", "613.28": "and that is really a level up in terms of adulting.", "615.76": "And you mentioned about a house,", "616.96": "you spoke about it in detail in one of the videos.", "619.48": "It's very in-depth, about 15 minutes long, if I...", "622.4": "Yeah, if I do not remember wrongly.", "623.6": "And it was, okay, the title of the video,", "625.52": "if you want to look it up,", "626.36": "is how I bought a resale HDB at 24 years old as a single.", "631.52": "So that's very impressive.", "632.96": "And it's a very popular video.", "634.6": "Many people clicked on it.", "636.28": "All the details are in there,", "637.24": "but could you give us an idea", "639.2": "so that we can get an idea of what is it about?", "641.24": "And then we can look into the video", "642.6": "for the rest of the details.", "644.6": "The video itself is titled", "646.0": "how I bought a HDB at 24 years old.", "648.44": "So I mentioned it in a previous video", "651.12": "that how I budget my 3.2K salary, something like that.", "654.56": "So a lot of people were already asking,", "656.52": "can you make a follow-up?", "657.44": "Like how the heck do you get a HDB at 24 years old?", "660.28": "So it starts out with intriguing situation,", "663.28": "because the general belief is that", "665.56": "unless you are 35 years old,", "667.96": "you cannot buy a house,", "669.04": "you cannot buy a HDB as a single.", "671.64": "The thing is you can, and...", "673.84": "So you need to get resale, then you need capital.", "676.04": "Yeah, only resale and you need money.", "678.96": "But in terms of the application process,", "681.64": "I didn't appeal to anybody in terms of buying the house.", "684.84": "I appealed for other things,", "685.96": "but buying the house was not one of them.", "687.56": "There's a whole list of schemes", "689.6": "that determine whether or not you're eligible.", "691.52": "And I happened to be eligible through one of the schemes.", "694.96": "And because of course there are going to be", "696.92": "exceptions to the norm,", "698.48": "and like the most common exceptions,", "700.08": "they will have a scheme for it.", "701.76": "Like if you're a, say a divorced parent with children,", "705.0": "or you're an orphan.", "706.28": "So for myself, it was the non-citizen family scheme", "708.68": "where I was applying with a non-citizen parent.", "711.48": "So yeah, so that was definitely something that was not known.", "716.92": "And so it became an interesting situation,", "719.2": "which I put in the title,", "720.28": "and I think that's why people clicked on it.", "721.64": "The how of it, I covered very clearly in the video,", "724.8": "in terms, and also what the process was for buying the house.", "727.88": "But I think more interestingly,", "729.36": "the why of it is also something that I covered", "732.16": "and is in the video.", "733.76": "Right, you were forced by circumstances in a way.", "736.04": "I think when people saw the title, it feels aspirational.", "738.72": "Yeah.", "739.56": "What can I do to buy a HDB at 24 years old?", "742.76": "I think I shattered that.", "744.16": "Yeah, exactly.", "745.0": "I undercut that.", "745.84": "And then it's like the bait and switch,", "747.0": "and you went into something deeper.", "748.28": "Yeah.", "749.12": "So you ended up telling me how you really share", "751.04": "your own personal situation.", "752.48": "And my takeaway was that it's really personal.", "755.16": "Everybody's situation is different.", "757.2": "And so this is what you have to go through", "759.6": "as compared to someone who aspires to get a HDB", "762.4": "at a young age, but you were forced by circumstances.", "765.48": "I didn't think about it as being aspirational, actually.", "768.12": "Like the whole time when I was going through the process", "769.8": "and even making the video, in my head, it was like,", "771.68": "oh, it's a heavy story,", "773.16": "like a lot of regret and frustration.", "775.64": "Like the thought of it being aspirational or inspiring", "778.16": "came a lot later.", "779.88": "After I published the video,", "780.72": "even the thumbnail, I remember I took a picture", "783.92": "and I put a black overlay on it", "785.2": "so that the text can appear more,", "786.64": "but basically it didn't look like,", "788.08": "wow, look at me, I did this.", "790.4": "Exactly.", "791.24": "Because that's more of your style,

the lifestyle that I'm living now.", "866.6": "Why do you think it blew up though?", "868.72": "Oh, why I think it blew up?", "871.08": "So a combination of two things.", "872.72": "Firstly, I think it was about February or March", "875.6": "that it started blowing up.", "877.56": "Like I was getting thousands of views each day", "880.8": "and also a lot of people subscribing, which was insane", "883.32": "because from December, end of December", "885.32": "when I created the channel to February,", "888.72": "I think I had like 30 subscribers and a few hundred views", "892.96": "which already felt like a lot.", "895.48": "But when it blew up, I think is", "897.52": "when the Singapore budget 2022 came out.", "900.04": "So I'm thinking with the algorithm and the keywords", "902.72": "because I kind of had all the keywords, I had budget,", "904.76": "I had Singapore, I had 2022.", "906.72": "So YouTube and Google itself was already, okay,", "909.36": "maybe my video time to push out now", "911.2": "because it intersects with the Singapore budget", "912.8": "that was coming out at the time.", "914.12": "And then the second thing that happened was", "915.64": "there was this really nice guy called Christopher.", "917.52": "I don't know him personally,", "918.4": "but there is this personal finance group", "920.4": "by Seedly on Facebook, right?", "921.88": "So he posted my video on there", "923.12": "and a lot of people found me through that Facebook group.", "926.32": "So those two things I think led to my video", "929.48": "being pushed by YouTube.", "931.36": "Really? You think it's the keyword?", "933.72": "It was the budget period?", "935.12": "I think so.", "935.96": "Are you just now playing yourself?", "937.4": "Really?", "938.24": "I mean, why else?", "939.08": "Because until February, nobody was looking at it.", "942.08": "And so it just so happens.", "943.36": "And I thought about it, like it crossed my mind.", "945.12": "Like, do you think maybe during the budget", "946.8": "with the algorithm, YouTube will push my video out?", "949.6": "Because I'm sure there are other channels", "951.12": "that are really budget related.", "952.2": "Yours is not even about the Singapore budget.", "953.72": "It's a personal budget.", "954.8": "Just that the keyword is the same, right?", "956.0": "Budget.", "957.16": "Contact location also the same.", "958.88": "Yeah, Singapore, Singapore.", "960.56": "I'm sure there are other videos with the word budget in it,", "962.84": "but they did not go up.", "963.76": "Plus the Christopher sharing on there.", "965.36": "Yeah, plus Christopher sharing on Seedly.", "967.84": "And okay, maybe if we look at my content,", "970.88": "the content of the video,", "972.28": "I mean, people understand theory very well, right?", "974.4": "They understand, like if you read about it,", "976.32": "you know what the 50-30-20 rule is telling you to do", "979.88": "or advising you to do.", "981.36": "But my video itself,", "983.48": "I am fully transparent about where each dollar is going.", "986.32": "Like what am I putting towards investments?", "988.12": "What am I putting towards fixed expenses and bills?", "990.6": "Before that, could you tell us about the 15-30?", "992.76": "Oh, okay.", "993.64": "I read about it on Seedly.", "995.0": "I don't think they came up with it, but I'm not sure.", "998.12": "It's a framework where you budget 50% of your salary", "1002.12": "towards expenses, 20% to savings, I believe.", "1007.84": "Yeah, 20% to savings,", "1009.08": "which is like your immediate emergency savings.", "1011.72": "30% to wealth.", "1012.56": "I've seen it.", "1013.4": "Investments, right?", "1014.24": "Oh yeah, yeah, wealth investments,", "1015.84": "putting towards retirement", "1017.08": "or any sort of long-term goal that you have.", "1018.76": "I think buying a house can be considered wealth.", "1021.12": "So it's really up to you to define.", "1023.52": "There's so many frameworks out there,", "1024.92": "but of course you have to adjust the percentages", "1026.8": "to your own scenario.", "1027.64": "Because sometimes expenses you cannot really change.", "1030.24": "So for me, I use that as a broad framework", "1032.84": "to think about how I should be budgeting my salary,", "1035.6": "because otherwise there's like a million different ways", "1037.88": "that you can organize your finances.", "1039.76": "So just having something as broad as that", "1042.24": "can help as a starting point.", "1043.64": "Yeah, and to keep you like in that general direction", "1046.48": "or trajectory.", "1047.8": "Yeah, I've seen like 10% for contributions,", "1050.4": "10% to parents, 10% that kind of thing.", "1052.8": "So there are just a bunch of different ways.", "1054.6": "I've also heard people saying that maybe 30% to wealth", "1056.8": "is too much and 50% is meant to be like for fixed expenses", "1061.0": "and then 20% for whatever you want to spend.", "1063.56": "Also, it's really up to you.", "1064.8": "It depends on your income as well.", "1066.2": "It depends on your income.", "1067.04": "3.2K is different from 10K, 20K.", "1069.32": "Yeah, for sure.", "1070.8": "So for myself, that's the framework that I go with", "1074.96": "because it's just easy to remember", "1077.0": "for where I am right now.", "1078.32": "And 3.2K, I think it's very relatable to many Singaporeans.", "1082.44": "Looking at this number,", "1083.6": "of course some YouTube channels or blog posts, articles,", "1086.92": "they will have like some crazy figure, right?", "1088.68": "But your content feels relatable.", "1091.4": "Something that, you know, yeah, this is my situation.", "1094.4": "And to add on to that,", "1095.8": "because people don't even talk about salary to begin with.", "1098.64": "So you don't even...", "1099.2": "It's a secret?", "1099.72": "You think that people don't share about it openly?", "1102.16": "Like, don't you think it's like a social thing?", "1103.56": "People don't really openly share how much they earn.", "1105.52": "Like they say, oh, like I'm quite well to do", "1107.92": "or like I earn high five figures, high four figures.", "1111.4": "I don't know.", "1111.76": "Like they put it in all these big terms.", "1113.52": "So even somebody telling you the exact numbers of", "1116.16": "their monthly income is rare, I feel.", "1119.44": "And on top of that, to so transparently share", "1122.56": "where that money is going, how that money is budgeted.", "1125.4": "Because context is very important here.", "1127.2": "Somebody, you can earn the same as your friend.", "1129.44": "Like both of you can be earning say 4.5K,", "1131.92": "but your material quality of life will look so different", "1134.36": "depending on your situation.", "1135.48": "Like if you're a single person living with your parents", "1137.64": "compared to if you're like a divorced mother", "1139.08": "with two children, both of you earning 4.5K,", "1141.6": "but your quality of life,", "1143.6": "your material quality of life can look so different.", "1145.92": "And so that was what I was hoping to share,", "1147.88": "like my salary, but also how I am working within", "1152.88": "this income to lead the life that I'm living now.", "1156.64": "And you need that kind of understanding of context", "1159.52": "to have empathy and to feel an emotional connection", "1163.48": "or like a connection that, you know,", "1165.44": "someone else is going through the same thing as you are.", "1168.0": "So that's like two sides I'm hoping to provide", "1171.28": "in this space, not just transparency about numbers,", "1173.72": "but also hopefully a more nuanced understanding of context.", "1177.52": "Yeah, I think the context is very important, right?", "1180.0": "Whether it's, we mentioned 3.2K or 10K,", "1182.44": "putting 50% of expenses would mean different things", "1185.08": "for different people.", "1185.96": "So about your standard of living,", "1187.24": "your personal choices in life.", "1189.56": "And, but what do you think about this whole trend", "1193.56": "that we are not willing to really share our income", "1198.72": "and you put your income out there openly?", "1200.72": "Yeah, yeah.", "1203.24": "Trend of not sharing income.", "1204.84": "I think that there are also some company policies.", "1207.04": "It's not a trend, it's a culture,", "1208.4": "culture would be a better word.", "1210.68": "Culture also reinforced by some company policies.", "1214.36": "I think you're not even allowed to talk about salary", "1216.32": "with your colleagues.", "1217.92": "So that one, I am for being open and transparent about it,", "1222.24": "but I've heard of company policy saying you cannot discuss.", "1225.16": "So I really don't know.", "1226.24": "I think the trend now compared to last time", "1230.04": "is more transparency, more openness to talking about it.", "1233.76": "Cause I think it's a negotiating point also.", "1236.2": "And you know, there was a whole thing where it was revealed", "1238.28": "that female employees are paid less", "1240.2": "and like the lack of transparency and discussion", "1242.96": "around salary contributes to that imbalance.", "1247.4": "So I see, I think the younger generation", "1250.72": "is more open to speaking about it, but it's not,", "1253.04": "I don't know, I guess people don't consider it", "1254.4": "polite conversation also to talk about how much you earn.", "1257.16": "Yeah, it's quite an individual personal decision", "1260.08": "for me to just like, you know what, I don't care.", "1261.44": "Like here's how much I earn.", "1263.08": "I see no shame in sharing it.", "1267.4": "Of course I've read articles that take the position", "1270.56": "of openness, transparency, because it like says", "1273.8": "a negotiating factor for companies, right?", "1275.8": "So when HR asks you, what's your previous salary", "1278.12": "and what's the expected salary,", "1279.32": "they have all the information,", "1280.2": "all the negotiating chips on their hands.", "1282.28": "Like you don't know anything, you don't know the budget,", "1283.88": "you don't know what was the previous person salary", "1286.32": "and you're just going blind.", "1287.68": "So, and there's this talk about that as well.", "1289.44": "And of course you mentioned about women's salary", "1291.84": "in a workplace being less than the male counterparts", "1295.12": "and it's being unfair.", "1295.96": "And that's because we don't have transparency", "1298.08": "on this whole situation.", "1298.92": "We don't have visibility on it.", "1300.56": "Yeah, it's very foggy right now.", "1302.76": "So that's one thing that we can really think about.", "1304.96": "And someone has to start, right?", "1306.36": "You put yourself out there first", "1307.52": "and you say this is your salary.", "1309.52": "How am I supposed to talk about my budget", "1310.96": "if I don't share my salary?", "1312.16": "I don't know, that was my thinking.", "1313.4": "Yeah, that makes sense.", "1315.4": "Maybe there is a very good reason", "1316.64": "why you shouldn't be sharing your salary to others,", "1319.12": "let alone online.", "1319.96": "But from where I am and where I was when I made that video,", "1323.36": "I'm still, I didn't see any other way.", "1326.24": "Okay, so two of your videos that blew up,", "1327.96": "one is on your monthly salary", "1329.24": "and the other one is on your HDB resale at 24 years old.", "1332.28": "How about something that you like among all these videos?", "1335.04": "Oh, um...", "1336.08": "You know, if something not blow up,", "1337.56": "the video is still there, but you love it so much.", "1339.16": "Like, so precious, why no one is clicking on it?", "1341.08": "For sure, for sure.", "1342.4": "Something like that.", "1343.68": "But I think it's also expectations versus reality.", "1346.12": "Okay.", "1346.96": "I mean, with the 3.2K video and the HDB video,", "1350.0": "I sort of knew that even beyond me,", "1352.44": "these videos would travel to a wider audience", "1355.92": "that is outside of the core audience", "1358.2": "that maybe cares about all the videos that I make", "1360.36": "or most of the videos that I make.", "1361.72": "The only series and the longest running series", "1363.8": "on my channel is my money diaries.", "1366.76": "Yeah, so that is the month by month follow up", "1369.12": "on the low buy project that I am doing, right?", "1371.96": "Maybe we can go into the low buy project at this point.", "1374.24": "So what is low buy and what is no buy?", "1376.4": "You know, the concept of it.", "1377.92": "So low buy is a variation of the no buy.", "1380.28": "So the no buy year is a project", "1383.04": "where you basically don't buy anything", "1385.72": "that is considered a non-necessity.", "1388.04": "Again, like definitions are all up to you here", "1390.04": "because what is a necessity to you", "1392.16": "is different to another person.", "1394.72": "But the gist of it is that you don't buy anything", "1396.8": "that is outside of the necessity category.", "1400.68": "And it could be that you do a no buy", "1403.16": "on certain categories as well.", "1404.56": "Like if you identify, say, clothing as your problem area", "1407.8": "that you want to do a no buy on,", "1409.04": "you can just restrict yourself in that category.", "1411.16": "And you don't buy anything for a certain period of time.", "1414.12": "It's not a lifestyle thing.", "1416.04": "Because if it's a lifestyle, then it's just your life.", "1418.0": "But it's more like a short-term project, I would say.", "1421.04": "It could be a month, it could be a year.", "1423.96": "And it's kind of like committing to an exercise regime", "1427.44": "or a specific diet for a certain period of time.", "1430.24": "So I see it in that kind of way.", "1432.48": "And then the low buy is a variation of that,", "1434.04": "which means that you impose a certain restriction", "1436.72": "on yourself.", "1437.56": "So for myself, it's $50 a month", "1439.04": "on what I consider is a non-necessity.", "1442.16": "And people do it for all kinds of reasons.", "1444.04": "It could be for something as simple", "1445.88": "as wanting to save money for that month.", "1447.8": "A lot of the times I see people doing the no buy", "1450.72": "because there is something in their behavior", "1452.68": "or their mindset that they want to change.", "1455.04": "Or like a no buy or a low buy,", "1457.6": "where there is a restriction on the amount", "1460.44": "or the quantity that you can buy, that you can purchase,", "1463.24": "that really helps with sort of maybe resetting", "1466.04": "or helping you reevaluate some of your beliefs", "1469.2": "and attitudes towards spending.", "1472.04": "The reason why you put the brakes on spending, right?", "1474.2": "Is because like, say you're driving in a car", "1476.16": "and you think that the car is faulty,", "1477.36": "you cannot repair the car and drive at the same time.", "1480.4": "So-", "1481.24": "You gotta stop.", "1482.08": "Yeah, you gotta stop.", "1482.92": "Look for help or just help yourself.", "1484.24": "The whole emotional process from like wanting the thing", "1487.52": "to actually buying the thing, it's an ongoing cycle.", "1490.28": "You're wanting the thing and then you're buying the thing.", "1492.88": "But if you interrupt that cycle,", "1495.2": "you stop at the buying part,", "1496.6": "then you can analyze the wanting part", "1498.48": "and why you want something,", "1500.88": "why you think you want something.", "1502.56": "So that's what I'm doing with this no buy or low buy.", "1505.48": "I am interrupting that thought process", "1507.32": "so that I can better understand myself", "1509.08": "and what my motivations are without like the end result,", "1514.12": "the consequence of already having bought the thing.", "1516.72": "So I am stopping the car and seeing how I can like", "1519.88": "change certain things or repair certain things.", "1522.64": "Okay, can I call it a detox in terms of a personal finance?", "1526.28": "Because you used the diet example just now, right?", "1528.16": "So it's a change of money habits", "1529.6": "and suspending habits.", "1531.2": "So essentially, like I mentioned,", "1532.68": "it's not a permanent thing.", "1533.56": "It's not a permanent lifestyle that you have to stick to,", "1536.28": "but you can try it for half a year, one year.", "1538.32": "So for yourself, it's been half a year?", "1539.96": "Yeah, I've been doing it for one year.", "1541.68": "One year, so you've been updating regularly", "1543.72": "the money diaries on YouTube channel.", "1545.16": "What has been your experience so far?", "1547.0": "Let's sum up half a year.", "1551.4": "Well, it's some of my most vulnerable videos", "1553.32": "because firstly, I'm sharing everything that I bought.", "1557.32": "So vulnerable.", "1560.0": "Yeah.", "1561.88": "So I'm sharing that.", "1563.48": "And then also the mindset changes over the last six months.", "1568.04": "I go into depth about that.", "1569.68": "So I did a mid-year check-in", "1572.16": "and something that has come up was", "1575.52": "me feeling quite out of place", "1578.96": "because shopping and spending money is so normal, right?", "1584.04": "But when I purposely take myself out of that cycle,", "1588.8": "when I stop driving,", "1590.04": "it gives you a different perspective.", "1591.76": "And if you're the only one who has stopped", "1593.52": "by the side of the road,", "1594.64": "then you're kind of lonely", "1595.48": "because everyone's going on without you.", "1597.56": "And something that I realized was that", "1599.96": "I don't really know what to do when I'm not shopping", "1602.12": "or when I'm not trying to actively desire things", "1605.04": "and work towards buying the thing that I desire.", "1608.24": "So I've been trying to read more, trying to work more,", "1611.68": "but I'm not used to not having this pastime.", "1615.64": "And so that has been something that I need to reflect on.", "1621.92": "Like imagine you've been a meat eater all your life", "1625.04": "and then suddenly you cut out meat.", "1626.4": "Then you're like, what do I put in my meals?", "1627.96": "Yeah.

something.", "356.32": "I really wanna go learn something", "357.64": "that the market values more.", "359.08": "Maybe like investing, maybe like trading,", "361.68": "maybe like design work, how to

National Library at Tampines,", "491.32": "I saw this book about the origins of coffee", "495.0": "and it has a lot of pictures inside.", "498.76": "It tells me everything.", "499.92": "You know, oh, in this part of the world,", "501.72": "they grow coffee that's sweeter,", "503.68": "you know, more floral", "504.92": "and the other side is a bit more bitter", "506.8": "and where did it come from?", "508.12": "How long has this been around?", "509.4": "What is the kind of roast that they do?", "511.16": "And I personally think it's pretty interesting.", "513.56": "Although I'm not a huge

there", "578.16": "selling you courses and programs,", "580.08": "you know, are quite questionable.", "583.16": "I'm not sure if,", "584.88": "I'm not saying that they are all fluff and shit.", "587.76": "Some people are really great.", "588.76": "I've learned a lot of good stuff,", "590.16": "but I personally believe that", "593.8": "you'll be able to learn more if you are more vested",

in a stock market,", "606.6": "I will recommend you to read some books.", "609.24": "You know, I think the famous,", "611.04": "one of the few famous investment books", "612.84": "are The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham,", "616.12": "you know, Pragmatic Capitalism by Cullen Roche.", "619.84": "I think these few are pretty good books, you know,", "621.88": "and of course read the one that Ray Dalio wrote,", "625.32": "Big Debt Crisis, you know,", "627.0": "that is like free online, just go download it.", "630.16": "Read his book also, Principles.", "631.68": "I think those are great books", "632.8": "and all these books are tough to read.", "634.92": "I tell you, they are really huge", "637.32": "and if you're new to this investing,", "640.56": "you will find that there are a lot of terms", "642.48": "that you need to pick up and Google.", "644.28": "So take your time,", "646.96": "but by reading, you build a fundamental base.", "652.56": "You validate on whether you're really interested", "654.96": "in this thing, whether you can really pull through,", "657.6": "you know, reading the book.", "659.04": "If you cannot even finish reading the book,", "661.0": "why pay three, 5,000 or 10,000 to go for a course", "664.76": "and you probably will never pick up the skill", "667.4": "because you're not even vested enough to finish a book", "670.28": "that is, you know, related to the course.", "673.48": "So what I'm trying to tell you is that", "675.24": "you don't need to pay so much to go for the course first.", "678.16": "Go to the library, get a book, validate yourself.", "681.76": "Make sure that, you know,", "682.68": "hey, I really kind of like this thing", "684.2": "and I don't mind paying a little more to go for the course", "687.84": "because I already validated myself.", "690.84": "And when you already have some basics,", "692.56": "you can go in and you learn more, you learn faster, right?", "696.8": "And I think that is cool.", "698.68": "So go to the library, start, you know, start there.", "701.92": "I think tons of free resources, let's not waste it.", "705.36": "Beautiful place, go.", "707.72": "And of course, it brings me to my third point.", "710.6": "You realize that all these side hustles,", "714.44": "if they have a business nature,", "717.0": "like if let's say you wanna start an Airbnb,", "719.56": "you have an extra space, you know,", "721.48": "or you wanna start investing in a market", "725.68": "or you wanna be able to start an online e-commerce store", "729.6": "or start a weekly magic gathering", "732.24": "that you charge membership in, whatever.", "734.2": "They all have some sort of business nature", "736.72": "and they require time to grow, right?", "740.04": "Anything that has a business nature", "741.52": "requires you time to develop it.", "744.96": "So that is a side hustle that requires you", "747.4": "to really hustle a little bit more.", "749.28": "But if you are in a hurry, if you're in a hurry,", "752.64": "you wanna make money fast.", "754.52": "Brings me to my third point, get a part-time job.", "759.8": "A part-time job essentially is an old way", "762.04": "of saying side hustle.", "763.36": "Hey, you know, I have a new side hustle at a cafe", "765.52": "being a barista.", "766.92": "10 years ago, you'd be caught,", "768.0": "oh, I'm doing a part-time job at this cafe.", "770.76": "You see?", "771.6": "So it's just a rebranded thing.", "773.12": "But why is it important?", "774.56": "Because I personally believe that the fastest way", "777.32": "to make money is to pick up a job", "779.52": "because you exchange your time for money.", "782.16": "And it's okay, that is where we start.", "784.4": "So if you're really in need for money,", "786.96": "go get a job, work weekends, do events,", "790.56": "just do some side jobs", "792.2": "and settle whatever you need urgently first.", "796.4": "Once you have done with your urgent matters,", "799.36": "then

be a smart side hustler,", "812.28": "you need to know where you're at.", "814.4": "Are you doing fine and just trying to", "817.64": "explore something different", "818.96": "because you're so good at what you do,", "820.2": "you're getting a little bit bored at the office.", "823.08": "Like the other day I had a friend,", "824.4": "we're talking and she was like,", "825.36": "I'm so bored, I'm a hotel manager and I'm so good at it.", "828.84": "It's getting boring and it's cool,", "830.52": "because if you keep doing the same thing,", "831.72": "you naturally become good at it.", "833.64": "So now that you're bored, what does she wanna do?", "835.72": "She was like, oh, maybe I wanna organize", "837.08": "some soap making workshops on the weekend.", "839.36": "I was like, cool, do it.", "840.84": "Because her goal is expression.", "843.2": "Her goal is creativity.", "845.24": "It's not just about making money fast.", "848.12": "So if her goal is to do something like that,", "850.72":

question a lot, like,", "97.6": "why should I need to save money?", "99.6": "What is the concept of saving?", "101.4": "How do I do it?", "102.4": "And, you know, why like that?", "104.8": "Because I

"and what am I trying to do with it.", "147.0": "You know, why do I need to save money?", "149.0": "Which is why today we're gonna talk about it.", "150.8": "And before I begin into the subject,", "154.4": "we need to, you know, talk a little bit about", "156.6": "what is the function of savings.", "159.4": "And essentially, savings is money not spent,", "163.6": "something that's idling", "165.0": "and doesn't have a meaning attached to it yet, right?", "169.4": "So, when I look at savings,", "171.4": "there are two functions that it primarily serves.", "173.8": "The first function is that it cushions your downturn.", "178.2": "Something happens to you, you lose your income,", "180.2": "you get injured, you know, you're not able to feed yourself.", "183.2": "Savings is there to tide you through, right?", "187.0": "So, it is there to help you to cushion your downturn.", "191.0": "And second function of savings", "192.6": "is to capitalize on opportunities.", "195.4": "So, you have all this excess cash sitting around,", "198.0": "they have nothing, no meaning attached to them yet.", "201.0": "And then suddenly you see something interesting,", "202.6": "oh, this company, you know, in the stock market,", "204.4": "it came down, should I buy it?", "207.0": "Yeah, there is an opportunity.", "208.8": "Or it's like, oh, you have a friend,", "210.4": "they're starting a new venture, you wanna join it, you know,", "212.8": "and you need a little bit of excess cash,", "214.4": "oh, that's an opportunity.", "215.4": "Or maybe another friend started a new company", "218.2": "or you wanna start a new company", "219.6": "and you just kinda need to,", "222.4": "you can't pay yourself as much, right?", "223.8": "You're a new company, but you have some money.", "225.8": "So, it can tide you through the early phases", "228.2": "of entrepreneurship, right?", "230.2": "Either way, it is there to help you", "232.6": "capitalize on opportunities and cushion your downturn.", "236.8": "Which is why we're gonna talk about", "238.8": "the three tranches of savings.", "240.4": "And the first tranche I'm gonna talk about", "242.2": "is a $1,000 emergency fund.", "245.8": "And many people online,", "247.2": "if you listen to other financial people,", "249.6": "they will talk about, you know,", "250.4": "this $1,000 emergency fund.", "252.8": "And I agree with them.", "254.2": "So, I don't need to come up with a new number.", "256.0": "Let's just take it.", "257.4": "I recommend you to first save $1,000 as emergency fund.", "261.2": "Why?", "262.2": "So, I think there are two reasons around this.", "265.4": "The first thing is this emotional and psychological", "268.2": "kinda, what do you call this?", "272.0": "Benchmark.", "273.6": "So, as you have not made money before,", "276.6": "you're just starting out to make money,", "279.2": "you wanna be able to, you know,", "281.4": "cross a certain kinda standard.", "284.0": "And I think $1,000 is kinda like a good standard to start.", "288.6": "You know, so, crossing that $1,000 to know that,", "290.6": "hey, I managed to save $1,000,", "292.4": "feels like a personal accomplishment.", "293.8": "I think that is a cool start.", "295.2": "But of course, as an emergency fund,", "297.8": "what can it do for you?", "299.2": "I thought about it long and hard and, you know,", "302.4": "I think $1,000 is quite a lot, man.", "304.2": "If you think about it, let's say your laptop breaks down,", "306.2": "which is, I'm talking about common scenarios, yeah?", "308.6": "Your laptop breaks down, and you have an emergency,", "311.4": "you have an urgent assignment,", "312.8": "you really need to get certain things done,", "315.2": "hey, $1,000 can get you a secondhand laptop", "317.8": "to tie you through that assignment.", "319.6": "Or tie you through even a year or two.", "321.4": "I think that's fair.", "322.4": "Or maybe your phone, very suay,", "323.8": "drop into the longgang, which is going to the drain,", "326.6": "then you need a phone.", "328.0": "$1,000 is good enough.", "329.2": "You can get a decent phone that will last you for a year or two.", "332.2": "Right? Or let's say you fracture your leg,", "335.8": "you need to go for some TCM adjustment,", "339.0": "or you got foot poisoning,", "340.8": "or even a small car accident,", "342.4": "something that's not fatal.", "344.0": "You need to pay for the toll guys to come,", "346.4": "and you need to go to the doctors.", "350.2": "As long as it's not crazy,", "352.6": "this $1,000 emergency fund is amazing.", "356.0": "It can solve a lot of your things.", "358.4": "And why I feel you need to have this kind of excess cash,", "362.4": "which is like $1,000 sitting around,", "365.4": "is because I don't want you to go into credit card bills,", "369.6": "or taking on installment plans.", "372.4": "Let's say you really need to get your car fixed.", "375.4": "Honestly, if you have a car in Singapore,", "377.8": "and you don't have $1,000 as an emergency fund,", "380.0": "I kind of question what you're doing.", "381.6": "But let's say we shift away from the car.", "384.8": "So let's say you lose your laptop breaks down,", "387.6": "or you lose your phone,", "389.4": "and you really need this going.", "391.4": "You really need a phone.", "392.2": "If not, you can't work.", "393.4": "I think it's fair these days.", "395.6": "If you don't have a phone,", "396.6": "it's pretty tough to do some things.", "400.4": "If you don't have this emergency fund,", "402.8": "this $1,000 emergency fund,", "404.2": "you end up slashing your credit card.", "406.4": "And because it is an additional expense,", "409.0": "chances are you will not be able to pay down this credit card ASAP.", "412.6": "So you will be incurring interest.", "415.4": "And interest rates of credit cards can be like 15% to 20%.", "419.4": "It's crazy.", "420.8": "Or you take on this kind of,", "422.4": "what do you call that?", "424.0": "Interest-free installment plans.", "426.0": "Sometimes I really wonder,", "427.2": "should they mark it as interest-free?", "429.2": "Because when you calculate the total amount that you pay for the phone,", "433.2": "through that kind of installment plan,", "434.8": "at Codds and Harvey Norman and those kind of places,", "437.6": "it's more expensive, right?", "438.8": "Than just buying the device itself.", "441.4": "So yeah, I'm not sure whether it is really interest-free.", "446.2": "But it's okay.", "447.6": "Not blaming them.", "449.0": "I'm just saying that from a personal point of view,", "451.4": "having this $1,000 as your emergency fund", "454.8": "can mitigate all these needs for additional credit", "458.0": "or additional spending into your balance sheet", "461.2": "when some small thing happens.", "463.0": "Of course, if you get in a serious accident,", "466.0": "a serious medical condition,", "467.4": "you go to the hospital,", "469.4": "this doesn't help you,", "470.6": "which is where insurance comes in.", "471.8": "But we're not talking about that.", "473.6": "We're not talking about insurance in this podcast.", "478.2": "We'll do it in another one.", "479.6": "Which brings me to my second saving tranche.", "482.8": "I believe that you need to save a year of survival expenses.", "491.8": "Recognize I say survival expenses.", "494.6": "So what is the difference between surviving and living?", "498.0": "Surviving, you're bare minimal.", "500.6": "Water, shelter, food, transport, basic stuff.", "504.2": "You can even throw away new clothes.", "507.0": "No budget for fashion.", "509.4": "And living expenses include everything.", "511.6": "Everything that it's kind of like how you live your life now.", "515.0": "You go to the restaurants on the weekend,", "517.4": "hang out with friends at the bars,", "519.0": "every month you buy a few new clothes.", "521.8": "That is your living expenses.", "523.0": "That is the standard that you're working with.", "526.4": "But I want you to save a year of survival expenses.", "530.0": "And what is the goal of survival expenses is that", "534.2": "if and if you lose your job, you lose your income,", "539.2": "you have one year's time.", "542.6": "I mean honestly if you lose your job, you lose your income", "544.6": "and you need to sort that out ASAP,", "547.8": "you will not be living like how you live now.", "550.6": "You need to go down to the bare minimal and sort out.", "554.6": "And I believe that one year is good enough to find a job", "559.0": "or find some sort of alternative income to make ends meet.", "563.2": "And yeah, to me, buying time.", "566.0": "Buying time to reposition and re-anchor yourself is very important", "570.2": "because the reality is there are many things that we cannot control.", "575.2": "Financial crisis happen, restructuring,", "577.6": "certain industries get disrupted or something happened to our family", "581.8": "and we need to put our job down and take care of the family.", "585.8": "For all sorts of reasons that you have,", "589.0": "you will have situations where you need time to reposition", "593.0": "and re-manage your finances.", "594.8": "So to me, why do I recommend saving tranche of a year of survival expenses?", "601.4": "Because I look at it as a time basis.", "605.4": "I am not the kind that is like percentage based", "607.6": "because they are very arbitrary to me", "610.0": "because I define savings as cushioning your downturn", "612.6": "and capitalizing on opportunities.", "616.0": "So having this one year of survival expenses is cushioning your downturn.", "622.0": "So having the first tranche of a thousand emergency fund", "624.8": "cushion your random things that happen", "627.0": "and this second tranche of a year of survival expenses,", "631.4": "these two will form your safety net, more or less.", "636.8": "It can cover almost anything that is systemically possible of happening.", "641.6": "More or less, you get it.", "643.2": "Yeah, there are a lot of random things that can happen", "645.0": "and to me, random error are very tough to mitigate.", "648.0": "In fact, random error cannot be mitigated.", "650.2": "You only mitigate systemic error.", "651.8": "So to me, these two, a thousand emergency fund", "655.6": "and your year of survival expense, it's good enough.", "658.6": "They form your safety net.", "660.0": "After you build these two,", "662.6": "you then can look at investing and planning for the future.", "666.4": "I want to set up a small fund for retirement.", "669.2": "I want to invest in a market to make my money work harder for me.", "673.0": "I want to set up a small fund for marriage.", "676.6": "Marriage is pretty expensive.", "679.4": "All these different little things that you do", "682.2": "and all these little funds that you set up", "685.4": "has a meaning attached to it.", "687.2": "They're not savings.", "688.8": "Back to the definition of savings.", "690.6": "Money not spent, idling, no meaning attached to it.", "693.6": "A fund is something that you're putting money aside", "697.0": "and there's a meaning and a direction attached to it.", "699.6": "Retirement, marriage, further education, whatever, or investing.", "704.8": "Either way, before you do all those other things", "708.0": "of planning for marriage, planning for a house,", "709.8": "planning for your future, I believe,", "711.8": "I strongly believe you need to have these two savings tranches settled.", "717.6": "They form your safety net.", "719.0": "It's so much easier to do things when you have these two covered.", "722.6": "And so what is the third tranche?", "724.4": "How much should I save?", "725.8": "This third tranche, I would personally recommend", "728.8": "that you save about three years of living expenses.", "733.0": "So this is a little bit of a projection.", "735.4": "It's a little arbitrary.", "736.6": "I myself have not reached this phase,", "739.4": "which is like three years of living expenses.", "742.6": "When I look at it, my living expenses and my survival expenses", "747.2": "have a difference of about half to a third.", "750.6": "So if it's a third, which means that if I really need money,", "756.2": "this three years of living expenses can help me", "759.8": "tight through for nine years to ten years.", "762.2": "It's great.", "763.4": "A lot of time to do a lot of things and turn around a lot", "766.2": "and sort out a lot of whatever shit that is going on.", "769.4": "And so yeah, to me, this is like an ultimate goal.", "772.6": "And I like to manage money with reference to time", "777.0": "because to me, it is like you got to manage your money", "781.0": "in context with your life.", "783.0": "And the undertone of life has time involved.", "786.4": "So I don't want to go into like an arbitrary number,", "789.4": "like a hundred thousand or like a random percentage", "793.4": "of your total wealth needs to be in savings", "796.6": "or all those kind of stuff.", "798.4": "But you know, I'm really open for discussion.", "801.4": "Email me, financialcoconut at gmail.com", "804.4": "and I want to hear what is your ultimate saving strategy.", "807.8": "But at this current moment,", "810.2": "I believe that three years living expenses", "812.6": "can be your ultimate savings target.", "814.4": "That is cool.", "815.2": "You're not in a rush for that.", "816.2": "It is the ultimate savings target.", "818.4": "So you build along the way.", "820.6": "And double note, this doesn't include retirement fund,", "823.2": "marriage fund, house fund, those kind of stuff.", "825.2": "Anything that has a meaning already attached to it", "827.4": "is not classified as savings in my view.", "831.8": "So to sum it all up,", "833.0": "savings is essentially money not spent,", "835.4": "idling with no meaning attached.", "837.6": "And it has two functions.", "839.0": "Cushion your downturn, capitalize on opportunities.", "841.4": "And I recommend you three different tranches", "843.6": "that you can target to save.", "845.4": "$1,000

your house,", "856.2": "you know, your investment funds,", "857.6": "all these other things.", "858.8": "And then the ultimate is a three years living expenses.", "864.0": "I think that is a good

down with you today", "152.0": "a little bit as to why I feel there is too much hype", "155.0": "and misconception about wealth.", "158.0": "But to begin with, we need to define wealth, right?",

two possibilities.", "306.0": "One possibility is that all the money went out to the rich people,", "309.0": "which I don't see that happening, you know?", "312.0": "We have some income disparity, but it's not crazy.", "316.0": "Suddenly, like one year, everybody becomes so broke", "318.0": "and then rich people become so rich.", "320.0": "And then the other possibility, which is what I believe,",

Orchard Road.", "337.0": "You don't realize that Orchard Road is more than just a shopping district.", "343.0": "The main road is Orchard Road, and behind all this Grange Road,", "346.0": "Scots Road,

everywhere.", "365.0": "They hide themselves also, right?", "367.0": "Which brings me to my first point.", "370.0": "The truly wealthy people are extremely, extremely low profile.", "377.0": "Those that you see online, those you see on Instagram,", "380.0": "unless they're the Saudi prince, which means the family controls the power", "384.0": "and then they control the money, you know,",

little bit more from all these endorsements,", "419.0": "but they are not truly wealthy because like what I said,", "422.0": "wealth is total assets.", "424.0": "So the truly wealthy people are

all wow.", "497.0": "This person is very rich.

problem,", "512.0": "that's why you say wealth doesn't solve problems.", "515.0": "The truth is money can help you solve some problems.", "518.0": "So if you have debt, you have credit card debt,", "521.0": "you've taken on some accident, you've gone to some accident,", "524.0": "you have some debt going, yes, money can solve those", "526.0": "because money pays down your debt.", "528.0": "But money is money, not wealth, right?", "532.0": "Money is just the tool and yeah, you pay it off.", "536.0": "Wealth is gathering a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of money for what?", "540.0": "That is very, very interesting when we think about it.", "544.0": "So I'm going to share with you a little bit of my personal story,", "547.0": "which got me to realize,", "548.0": "why do I think wealth doesn't solve all my problems?", "552.0": "Growing up, I came from a business family and,", "555.0": "okay, maybe a failed business family,", "557.0": "so that means they used to do very well and it's no longer the case.", "560.0": "And I subconsciously have observed when I was young,", "566.0": "now when I look at it, I realize,", "568.0": "I'm conscious now about why I do certain things.", "571.0": "But when I was young, I subconsciously observed that", "574.0": "the guys and the ladies that were doing better at home", "579.0": "were more listened to, right?", "582.0": "So I have this uncle, my first uncle,", "586.0": "he was doing extremely well in Japan,", "589.0": "selling recycled steel and those kind of stuff,", "593.0": "exporting, importing, and everyone listened to him.", "596.0": "Everyone crowded around him and he had a lot of say in the family,", "601.0": "which is why I subconsciously registered that,", "605.0": "hey, I must be very, very rich, then people will listen to me.", "609.0": "So I went through tons and tons of bullshit.", "613.0": "I accidentally got into a scam,", "616.0": "I lost a lot of friends, lost a lot of money, of course,", "618.0": "because it's a scam.", "620.0": "We'll talk about it in another podcast.", "622.0": "And I went into businesses after businesses without thinking.", "625.0": "I was in a lot of rush, a lot of rash,", "627.0": "and just going through this whole emotional rollercoaster ride", "631.0": "and business rollercoaster ride", "633.0": "to ultimately realize that actually all I wanted", "636.0": "was for people to listen to me and to be heard and to connect.", "642.0": "It's not because I need a lot of money.", "644.0": "And I believe many people are like that.", "647.0": "Many people go through this whole self-insecurity", "651.0": "and we feel that money and being wealthy", "655.0": "gives us power, gives us control, gives us influence.", "658.0": "But actually all this perception creates this idea", "663.0": "that wealth can solve everything.", "665.0": "It becomes a proxy.", "667.0": "We create a perceived proxy to solve all these problems.", "671.0": "That means we believe that wealth can solve this problem,", "673.0": "but in actuality, the problem can be solved", "675.0": "just by addressing the problem.", "677.0": "So when I became conscious about,", "679.0": "oh, that's why I want to make so much money,", "681.0": "actually all I wanted to do was to be heard", "684.0": "and understood and connected and respected.", "688.0": "That was when I decided to take a break", "690.0": "from the pursuit of wealth to re-understand", "694.0": "and recalibrate what is wealth to me,", "696.0": "and at the same time, solve that fundamental need for connection.", "701.0": "And yeah, so I believe at this current point in time,", "705.0": "I'm in a better relationship.", "707.0": "My parents, my family, and my friends.", "710.0": "It was crazy a few years ago.", "712.0": "I was alone most of the time, and it didn't help.", "716.0": "So when I became conscious, I realized that,", "719.0": "yeah, it is true that wealth doesn't solve all problems.", "724.0": "Money, on the other hand, can.", "727.0": "It can pay down your debt,", "729.0": "it can help you to capitalize on the market opportunities,", "732.0": "it can do a lot of things.", "733.0": "But you don't need to be extremely wealthy", "735.0": "to solve all your problems.", "736.0": "You just need to make some cash to turn around your issues.", "739.0": "Okay, you get the idea, see the difference?", "741.0": "Which brings me to my third point,", "744.0": "which is, wealth occurs with income surplus", "749.0": "compounded over time.", "752.0": "It is not a speed game, it is a time game.", "756.0": "A lot of people have this misconception that,", "758.0": "wow, I joined a tech startup, I can make money very fast,", "762.0": "I need to do this to make money very fast,", "763.0": "and I can be very rich.", "764.0": "Everybody talks about how to make money fast,", "766.0": "how to make money faster, how to make money faster,", "768.0": "and they believe that by making money faster,", "771.0": "they can become wealthy.", "773.0": "Which, technically, is not wrong.", "776.0": "If you gather more resources faster,", "778.0": "gather more assets, you become wealthy.", "779.0": "You're not wrong.", "780.0": "But the reality is, not many people can do that.", "784.0": "Not many people are able to make a lot of money in a short time.", "788.0": "You've got to be able to create the next big startup,", "791.0": "you've got to be able to hustle,", "794.0": "you've got to sacrifice a lot of life into the pursuit of wealth.", "800.0": "But if you realize that, in actuality,", "805.0": "the fundamental factor of wealth compounding is time,", "810.0": "and not speed,", "812.0": "you become that much more calm about it.", "815.0": "Many, many wealthy people today have generational wealth.", "820.0": "That means two, three generations ago,", "822.0": "maybe four, five generations ago,", "823.0": "someone in their family decided to do something", "828.0": "and gather some wealth,", "830.0": "and then the next generation continued to gather some wealth,", "832.0": "and the next generation continued to gather some wealth,", "834.0": "and many of them get to where they are", "836.0": "because of compounding over time.", "840.0": "Think about it.", "842.0": "In Singapore, do we have many unicorns?", "844.0": "No, right?", "846.0": "At best, it's Grab, and he's not even Singaporean.", "849.0": "And now there's a carousel, right?", "851.0": "And that's the best.", "853.0": "What about everyone else?", "855.0": "Why do we have so many rich families?", "857.0": "We don't have a lot of new startups or a lot of global enterprises.", "861.0": "Many of these families have very old wealth.", "864.0": "They own the banks, they own production,", "868.0": "the palm production, the oil production,", "870.0": "they own a lot of old businesses,", "872.0": "which back then was very small,", "875.0": "but they compounded, compounded, compounded, compounded.", "879.0": "Even when you look at an F&B chain like Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,", "883.0": "everybody goes to Bak Kut Teh,", "884.0": "okay, it's okay,", "885.0": "but if you go to Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,", "887.0": "the rumor has it that it was the second generation", "891.0": "that took up the business and rebranded it,", "893.0": "and then bring it to where it is today.", "896.0": "The first generation did all the hard work,", "899.0": "refining the recipe and sorting out the suppliers,", "902.0": "making sure the distribution,", "904.0": "fixing down the team, setting up the infrastructure.", "907.0": "They did their hard work,", "908.0": "and then the second generation did their hard work too,", "911.0": "expanding and hustling and picking better locations to replicate,", "915.0": "and then franchising it, blah, blah, blah.", "917.0": "So you realize that most wealth and most success,", "921.0": "especially in business, is compounded over time.", "925.0": "So you can be the first generation to slog and hustle", "928.0": "and gather wealth and create surpluses", "931.0": "and compound your excess, your income surplus.", "935.0": "You can compound them, and in time, you will become wealthy.", "939.0": "Yeah, that is how it works.", "941.0": "You don't need to be in this crazy chase for short, quick money.", "946.0": "I want to make money fast, I want to be wealthy fast.", "948.0": "And more often than not, if you're in a rush,", "951.0": "if you're trying to do this hastily,", "954.0": "there are some underlying anxiety", "956.0": "and some underlying issues that you should look at.", "960.0": "Right?", "961.0": "So yeah, you get the point.", "963.0": "My three misconceptions about wealth.", "966.0": "First thing is that the wealthy people, very low profile.", "969.0": "They're not as crazy as you think, high and mighty and always partying.", "974.0": "Those people are party people.", "976.0": "They're not wealthy.", "977.0": "Not all, some are, but not all.", "980.0": "Next is wealth doesn't solve all problems.", "982.0": "Money can solve some short-term debt issues,", "985.0": "turn around some stuff,", "986.0": "but you don't need a lot, a lot, a lot of money to solve all your problems.", "989.0": "In fact, even if you have a lot, a lot of money,", "991.0": "you still have relationship problems", "992.0": "because you don't really know how to connect with your wife.", "995.0": "You still have parenting problems", "996.0": "because your kid is a different generation", "998.0": "and you don't spend time to understand the different generation.", "1000.0": "You still have issues at work", "1002.0": "because you and your colleagues think differently.", "1004.0": "You have tons of issues everywhere, and money cannot solve it all.", "1007.0": "Wealth doesn't solve it all.", "1009.0": "Money can solve some short-term problems.", "1012.0": "And of course, the last point is that", "1014.0": "wealth occurs compounded over time.", "1018.0": "It's not a speed game.", "1021.0": "Okay?", "1022.0": "So, yeah, I hope you learned something today.", "1024.0": "See ya.", "1027.0": "Test, test.", "1028.0":

to travel", "321.16": "to Japan I need maybe about 1,500 Sing for two weeks, about there.", "329.44": "So then that becomes my goal and there's a breakdown, so maybe 400 student air ticket", "334.68": "and then how much for lodging and etc.", "337.44": "So I go through this whole shopping process and meeting with all these relevant experts", "343.56": "online and I get a better clear idea exactly what I want.", "348.28": "So if this year my goal is to travel to Japan for a month, how do I do it?", "352.8": "And then I just go around shopping and do all these things and if let's say your goal", "358.24": "is to get a house, I always talk about getting a house because that is definitely something", "361.56": "that I'm looking forward to.", "363.12": "I'm just not sure whether I want to do it in Singapore but let's say your goal is to", "366.68": "get a HDB, you already have a partner, you guys are going to get married and you want", "370.8": "to get a HDB in two years' time, three years' time, maybe it's good to start now.", "376.36": "In three years' time you want to get a HDB, now you can go and look for, go to the HDB", "380.72": "board, ask them for questions, how this thing works, get a better idea of what the prices", "385.96": "are, how much do you actually need to get a HDB or to get a BTO built to order.", "392.96": "So when you have that kind of plan, let's say my target to get a HDB in a new area,", "398.32": "I have a BTO, I got to pay 10,000 cash upfront.", "401.2": "Okay, in three years' time I got to pay $10,000 cash.", "405.0": "So what am I going to do from now to three years' time to pay this $10,000 cash?", "409.44": "I have a lot of clarity.", "411.2": "So I know I talk a lot about clarity in this podcast and to me it's extremely important,", "418.68": "whatever you want to do, go and look for the experts.", "421.0": "It need not be a physical person, it can be a book, it can be online videos, it can be", "424.64": "a community online, look for these people and then they've already done it, why not", "429.04": "ask them how much does it cost, what is the way to go, any tips to save a little bit or", "434.92": "what are certain things that you cannot miss, what are some things that are not usually", "439.0": "talked about but when you do it, it happens.", "441.68": "So to me that is one of the most important steps towards getting your financial goals", "446.96": "and actually achieving it.", "449.08": "So look for these experts, they are all around, these days it's very easy to find them and", "454.44": "it's going to change this whole game of yours.", "458.68": "Time and time again you set up goals every year, every year, you want to get promoted,", "463.08": "you want to make how much income, you want to save how much, you want to get a good body,", "468.44": "you want to travel somewhere, you want to buy a house, whatever.", "471.4": "But many a times it is just a piece of paper that we write during December and then we", "477.04": "just secretly write to ourselves, next year I'm going to try to do this.", "480.68": "And you don't tell anyone, you don't go and look for people that have already done it,", "484.36": "you don't go and reference, you don't do your shopping.", "488.2": "The chances are you will never hit it because you don't know, everything is just in your", "492.08": "mind, it's just a blank thing, it's arbitrary.", "495.8": "So let's be clear, first thing you need to do to set clear financial goals and achieving", "500.08": "it is to go and shop.", "502.04": "If this is something that you think you want it, go and look around, ask for people, ask", "506.32": "for experts and try to understand how much you need.", "509.64": "And then you set a money value on this.", "511.92": "If I want to travel to Japan, maybe I need $2000, I want to get a mortgage, I need $10,000", "516.72": "cash, I want to save $5000 this year.", "519.64": "There is a money value across all these different goals.", "524.64": "We cannot run away from this because we live in a capitalistic society, everything is based", "529.36": "on demand supply, on a capitalism canvas.", "533.74": "So realizing that there is always a money value tag behind all these things, it's extremely", "539.24": "important.", "540.24": "Even if you want to get fit, you want to join a yoga class, then you go and find out how", "544.64": "much does it cost to do yoga, right?", "547.76": "And are there ways to be cheaper?", "550.04": "I saw some meetup groups doing yoga at Raffles Place.", "552.76": "Yeah, there are a lot of interesting options but going and doing all the shopping and setting", "558.56": "a money value is extremely, the money goal is extremely important to setting clear financial", "563.76": "goals and achieving it.", "565.24": "Which brings me to my second point.", "567.88": "After you have that money goal, set a plan.", "572.36": "Setting the plan, like I previously talked about, the first thing you need is a timeline.", "577.56": "You need a timeline based on this money goal that you want to do.", "581.8": "So let's say my goal is to travel to Japan this year, and after all my research, I realized", "586.88": "that, okay, if I travel during post-spring, which means right after the cherry blossom", "595.8": "season, it's cheap and cool, and cheaper at least because it's off super peak, and it's", "601.3": "relatively cooling weather, and that was the time I traveled to Japan.", "605.26": "And after researching all the different places to stay and flight tickets everywhere, I decided", "611.34": "that, okay, I need about $2,000 to travel to Japan for two weeks.", "617.26": "Let's say that's the plan.", "619.74": "So with that $2,000, I have to factor that into my budget because I have an ongoing income", "625.1": "of $3,000 a month.", "627.7": "In a year, I want to travel to Japan.", "630.18": "By next year, I have 12 months to collate $200.", "634.58": "So every month, I just need to set aside $100 over to my travel to Japan budget.", "641.98": "And that is as simple as it is.", "643.78": "But certain things are a little bit more complicated.", "646.58": "So after you have that money goal, if your goal is a house, three years, five years,", "650.9": "a longer plan.", "652.7": "So with that money goal, and with the timeline that you know, and after calculating your", "657.78": "monthly contribution that you need to contribute to this goal, you may want to consider investing.", "664.18": "Because investing may give you that kind of additional impact and that kind of additional", "668.38": "leverage to be able to then compound for more.", "672.66": "And maybe in a shorter period of time, you can have that.", "675.74": "And in any case, if there's a surplus within the plan, then you can take this surplus to", "679.9": "do something else.", "681.62": "So to me, that is extremely important.", "683.46": "After meeting the experts and getting your money goal and the strategy, then you set", "689.38": "a plan, which is timeline, the monthly contribution, and whether to invest this money if I have", "695.02": "a longer time horizon.", "696.26": "I think that's extremely important.", "698.66": "Which brings me to my third point, which I think it's really cool.", "702.1": "That is to set up a bank account for this goal and this thing that I want to do.", "709.18": "So if I want to save a certain amount of money, I will set up a bank account for savings.", "712.78": "If I want to create an investment fund for myself, for my retirement, I will create a", "716.86": "bank account for that.", "718.1": "And even if I want to travel to some place and I'm going to need to save up maybe a few", "723.98": "thousand dollars, I will create a bank account for that.", "727.46": "And I realize that not many people do that.", "729.86": "I used to think that it's very common, everyone has a few bank accounts for different purposes.", "733.9": "But I realize that it is extremely uncommon.", "737.38": "Most people only have one or two bank accounts.", "739.54": "In fact, many people only have one and many credit cards.", "743.22": "So to me, why setting up a bank account is so important, right?", "747.82": "Because the first thing is it is a commitment to the goal.", "750.62": "So after you've met all the experts and do all the planning and understanding, and then", "755.98": "you've set up a plan with the monthly contribution, the timeline, everything that you need to", "760.78": "have, going to the bank and queuing up and setting up a bank account gives you that commitment", "766.5": "to this goal that you want to have.", "769.46": "Let's be realistic.", "771.62": "You don't want to be establishing many goals for the new year.", "775.74": "Let's keep a few things simple.", "777.7": "Start with simple things like I want to save a certain amount of money, I want to plan", "780.86": "a short little trip, I want to do small little, little stuff and then we build from there.", "784.9": "Set up an investment fund.", "786.58": "I think those are cool stuff.", "787.86": "And at least you should have maybe three or four bank accounts.", "791.42": "One for investing, one for savings, and one for entertainment.", "795.74": "All these will help you in your budget.", "797.22": "I'm going to talk about it in another podcast.", "799.66": "But yes, setting up a bank account is that commitment to the goal.", "804.58": "And it allows you to segregate the money immediately.", "807.82": "You don't want to put everything in a clump in one account.", "812.46": "Everything is a mental note.", "813.46": "It's going to test your mental capacity.", "815.22": "From time to time you get stressed and then you want to do some self-care or whatever", "820.02": "kind of therapy that you want to do.", "822.82": "Then retail therapy is rubbish.", "825.98": "Whatever, all those things that you want to do, it will then affect your goal because", "831.94": "you're clumping everything into one account and it's all a mental note.", "835.5": "And when you go into a mode like this, when you're very emotional, you want to do retail", "839.18": "therapy and all those kind of rubbish things that the market tells you to do, then more", "845.46": "often than not you cannot control that spending and it may eat into all these different plans", "850.74": "that you have prior at the beginning of the year.", "853.9": "So set up a bank account, it's commitment to yourself, separate the money and the third", "857.54": "best thing about a bank account is that you can auto-transfer.", "860.9": "You can set automated transfer to this.", "864.18": "So to me that is amazing because it's like an auto-commitment to your goal already.", "870.06": "So wherever you are, you will definitely hit that goal because you understand how much", "876.46": "you have, you have a clear plan of how much contribution you need and then you set up", "880.46": "a bank account to automate that process of contribution from your income bank account.", "885.82": "So I think that is cool, right?", "888.14": "One of the easiest way to set clear financial goals and achieving it.", "892.02": "Trust me on this.", "893.02": "Give it a shot, do it and let me know if you have other strategies to help you and help", "898.46": "us, help all of us to achieve your financial goals this year.", "902.34": "I wish you all the best and I hope you learn something today.", "904.86": "See ya!",

rekindling of old relationships, building of new relationships and it's been", "28.04": "great.", "29.08": "And yeah, so the topic for today is about money and relationship and in fact that is",

money.", "51.72": "And this is something that a lot of people have been asking me, how do I manage relationships", "57.24": "and money at the same time?", "58.92": "And when you look at it, there are like multiple layers, right?", "61.12": "You got to first manage your relationship with money, right?", "64.88": "If you don't have a healthy relationship with money, how are you going to have a healthy", "68.88": "relationship with someone else with money involved?", "72.04": "So it's many, many layers and we are going to have a whole month of interesting content", "76.68": "around

topic is 3 ways to cultivate a healthy relationship with money.", "115.56": "Yeah, before we go any further, I got to be really honest with you guys that I have a", "121.08": "hard time crafting topics for this month.", "126.32": "Like the theme relationship and money is like so broad, like there's so many things to talk", "131.56": "about under this umbrella.", "134.2": "And you know, I've prepared some content for you, you know, 4 episodes for the month.", "140.16": "But in any case, if there are some things that I've missed out which you know, definitely", "144.48": "will have, please feel free to ask, you know, ask the community together.", "149.36": "We grow as a collective and yeah, ask all kinds of questions, you know, join our telegram", "154.52": "group that's the fastest way

have.", "165.68": "And yeah, to kickstart the month, we are going to talk about 3 ways to cultivate a healthy", "169.62": "relationship with money.", "171.36": "But to begin with all this, you know, we always do this because to me, a lot of words that", "175.74": "we use have a lot of nuances, a lot of experiences and you know, emotions that are attached to", "181.94": "these words and we may be, you know, seem like using the same word but we mean a total", "186.9": "different thing.", "187.9": "So, we're going to start with defining what is a healthy relationship, what are the elements", "192.74": "of a healthy relationship.", "194.46": "And when I look at it, a healthy relationship is defined as a relationship that is built", "199.66": "on understanding and acceptance.", "203.1": "So when I look at a healthy relationship, it is not like a few-few thing, you know,", "207.34": "like a lot of people talk about love at first sight, few-few, you know, feel good, that's", "211.3": "it lah.", "212.36": "But that is not how I look at creating a healthy relationship.", "217.54": "A healthy relationship must be built on understanding and acceptance because if you cannot comprehend,", "222.74": "you know, the relationship, you cannot understand the situation and you cannot accept it for", "227.26": "what it is, you have a lot of emotional, you know, baggage that goes into this thing which", "232.08": "is what a lot of people have.", "233.48": "A lot of people have a lot of emotional baggage, you know, with money and especially when in", "239.08": "our society, we don't really talk about it, we don't converse about it, the school don't", "243.22": "teach us, our families, we don't talk about it as well.", "246.46": "You know, it's like a given as if like suddenly you grow up and you start making money, you", "250.02": "ought to have a good relationship with money, you ought to understand how it works, you", "253.82": "ought to be able to accept it for what it is.", "257.02": "Pardon me.", "259.82": "But yeah, because I see so many people doing that, like so many people, they come to me", "264.28": "and we talk about it and you know, we all have this common, you know, some kind of common", "270.7": "theme going around which is that we don't talk about money growing up, the school doesn't", "274.46": "teach us and somehow we are expected to create a good relationship and understand money.", "279.8": "This is like, I will put it out, you know, it's just so complicated.", "284.56": "But anyway, you like it or not, over time, you need to be able to define what is money", "291.44": "to you and how you are going to work with it.", "294.36": "You are going to be able to look at it and build a healthy relationship, you know, understand", "298.56": "it for what it is.", "300.36": "And you like it or not, you got to work with money because the world, the whole world has", "305.8": "subscribed to capitalism, you know, and that is how everything is decided, you know, everything", "311.68": "is attached to a dollar value and that is our way of distributing resources.", "316.96": "You know, unless you are going to like champion and debunk capitalism and try to pull it down.", "322.6": "If not, you know, if we are going to accept that, you know, the world runs on capitalism", "326.6": "and there is a market economy, you know, everything has a dollar value and we transact and we", "332.32": "distribute resources based on money, then we have to learn, you know, because if you", "337.8": "think about it, right, you work 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week just to make money.", "342.44": "But half the people, I think, okay, maybe more than half the people don't really know", "346.04": "how money works.", "347.04": "They don't understand how things go.", "349.68": "But you are already different because you are on the podcast and we are going to talk,", "352.8": "you know, so much more about it and I hope you have grown over this past few months with", "357.48": "the financial coconut.", "358.76": "I thank you for listening and sharing with your friends.", "362.12": "So, the first way to cultivate a healthy relationship with money is financial journaling.", "370.76": "It's super cheesy but trust me, a lot of people have used this method.", "374.96": "A lot of my friends have tried this method after I shared with them.", "378.68": "It doesn't need to be super complicated.", "381.04": "I think the easiest way is to just record down your spending.", "386.2": "That is the easiest way, you know, there are definitely like financial journaling tools", "389.6": "out there, some of which are like, my goodness, so complicated, you know, some are just too", "395.84": "framed in a way that may not fit you.", "399.36": "But when I look at it, the easiest way is to start recording your expenses.", "404.2": "That is the easiest way because when you start recording your expenses in your financial", "408.28": "journal, you get more clarity about how much you spend, why you spend certain things and,", "414.08": "you know, to me, that is extremely important because that is you building an understanding", "418.94": "with money.", "419.94": "Over time, you will be able to spot a pattern, right?", "424.1": "At first, it looks very stupid, right?", "426.46": "You got to like collect the receipts and, you know, write down or every night you go", "430.98": "home at the end of the whole day, you're so tired, you still got to kind of like, you", "434.86": "know, collective, you know, collect your memory and, you know, kind of jot down what you spend,", "440.86": "you know, all these kind of nitty-gritty stuff and it gets tiring.", "445.14": "I get it.", "446.14": "It doesn't sound very appealing right from the get-go.", "449.26": "But over time, it builds a data point because you can see, you know, like daily how much", "454.3": "you spend on food, you know, on what days do you end up taking grab, taking the taxi", "460.22": "because you're really tired and drained from work or is it a weekend thing?", "463.7": "Every weekend, you get a grab because you go and party.", "466.7": "You can sort of see your emotional spending, things that you do when you feel very, you", "471.9": "know, frustrated, very angry and, you know, emotionally overwhelmed.", "475.58": "It's like you, you know, chill with your friends, come up for a drink, you ask your", "479.34": "girlfriend go for shopping, you know, you do all these different kind of things.", "482.5": "All these are emotional spending and, you know, through financial journaling, through", "487.46": "recording down all these different spendings that you do, you get so much more clarity", "492.46": "because it's being laid out in front of you.", "494.06": "You cannot hide from it, right?", "496.22": "You know, every month, you're spending like few hundred on drinks.", "499.58": "Then you question yourself, why do I spend so much on drinking?", "503.02": "Actually, all I want to do is to hang out with my friends.", "505.78": "I don't really need to drink.", "507.38": "I don't really need the bar.", "508.86": "I just want a place to chill and hang out.", "511.46": "And when you look at it, it's like, oh, okay, so if that's the case, then what do I do?", "515.14": "Can I change this?", "516.78": "You know, I know my need.", "517.78": "I know I need to socialize.", "519.46": "I know I need the emotional connection, the relationship building.", "523.34": "But is there another way?", "524.34": "Can I, you know, hang out at my friend's place or can I pick up a sport with my friend", "529.06": "rather than, you know, always drinking and getting fat, right?", "531.54": "Maybe we should all go learn how to play tennis, rent a tennis court,", "534.98": "and then let's just play together, you know, all amateur, you know, get bunched by the ball.", "538.54": "But it's okay, we learn something and we fulfill our need of socializing.", "542.66": "We fulfill our need of like releasing our emotions,", "545.78": "all the stress that we build up over the week, over the month at work.", "550.06": "You know, let's go for a game of tennis, right?", "552.02": "We don't really need drinks, right?", "554.42": "And that's probably why myself and all my friends are getting really fat these days, huh?", "559.34": "And yeah, that is financial journaling for you.", "562.38": "You know, you don't exactly need to buy like a financial journal.", "565.5": "I know these days there are a lot of people selling all sorts of journals out there.", "569.86": "If you somehow have bought it, you're going to commit to it.", "572.26": "Okay, so be cool stuff.", "573.9": "But if not, you know, just go and

everyone fasting.", "724.46": "But whatever they do, it's fine.", "725.98": "Essentially, what I'm trying to get you to do is to do a financial fast.", "731.14": "So, what you can consider doing is,

your mind.", "757.62": "I realized that I actually do a lot of financial fasting when I'm traveling.", "763.14": "Because when I'm traveling, I have a designated time frame, right?", "766.78": "I have like a month in Japan, I have like two months in Thailand or whatever it is,", "771.86": "and I set a budget for it.", "774.82": "So, when I do that, I become extremely conscious about money.",

a lot.", "926.02": "Mostly, you can do a lot.", "927.06": "If you have no idea, just go and listen to, you know, the previous, one of the previous episodes", "931.38": "about how to have fun on a

goal is not that to spend very, very little but the goal is to be very much more aware and conscious", "948.74": "of how you spend, what kind of choices that you do, right?", "952.02": "So that you understand your kind of relationship with money.", "955.14": "Ultimately, only with that kind of clarity and that kind of consciousness,", "959.5": "would you be able to cultivate a healthy relationship with money?", "963.3": "At least that is in my view.", "965.18": "Okay, so I, you know, hope that you will do a financial fast.", "968.34": "And if you happen to do a financial fast, you know, jot down what happened that day and share with us, okay?", "973.94": "Join our Telegram group.", "975.02": "I want to hear from you.", "976.06": "Definitely, I'll be very interested in what you guys did.", "978.58": "That'll be fun.", "979.94": "Which brings me to my third point.", "983.02": "So yes, first point, you do financial journaling.", "985.42": "Second point, you do a financial fast.", "987.94": "And the third point is have a conversation about your finances with friends that you trust.", "996.78": "To me, that is very important because sometimes everything is locked in our head, right?", "1001.26": "You realize like financial journaling is a very alone thing.", "1003.5": "You got to do your own journal.", "1005.06": "You can always get a friend to do journal together, right?", "1006.98": "They do their journal, you do your journal.", "1008.5": "And then you guys have a financial conversation at the end of the week, right?", "1012.5": "And to me, I think there is very, very little discussion about our finances.", "1017.5": "We don't even really talk to our friends like how we spend.", "1021.06": "You know, some friends don't even know how much you make.",

higher level, you know, elements in personal finance.", "1033.98": "So when I look at it, it's always the basics first, right?", "1036.18": "Income and expenses.", "1038.42": "So I want you to have the kind of honest conversations with your friends, people that you trust,", "1044.46": "you know, to talk about money, to talk about how things are going for everyone, you know,", "1048.26": "how are

is extremely important.", "1058.18": "And it is like a taboo in our society.", "1060.5": "It's a taboo and I don't know why it's a taboo, but it is a taboo.", "1064.06": "Like we don't talk about money and everyone's just like, you know, so alone in this part of life.", "1072.46": "And yes, money is a part of life.", "1074.54": "We cannot lie about that because we all live in a capitalistic society.", "1079.1": "Till that thing change, till the day that capitalism fall, money will be so important", "1084.22": "and it manages this whole system, right?", "1087.66": "So find a friend that you can trust, have a good conversation.", "1091.7": "I know sometimes you may not know how to, you know, do this conversation thing with your friend.", "1096.5": "It may sound really odd, but, you know, just start with simple, honest requests like,", "1101.5": "hey, bro, I want to talk about money, you know, would you be interested to have a conversation?", "1106.58": "That is it, right?",

a healthy relationship with money.", "1126.26": "Three very, very practical ways that you can actually do, you know, not some spiritual shit", "1131.58": "because when you Google, like, or when you YouTube, like, relationship, money, right,", "1136.58": "there's tons of guru out there that give you all this frou-frou ideology, which, yes, those are important,", "1141.94": "but let's do things that are practical and easy for us.", "1145.34": "So the first thing is to do a financial journal.", "1147.86": "Start with recording your expenses every day.", "1150.02": "It gives you a lot more clarity as to how you spend, why you do certain things, spot the pattern.", "1154.5": "Need help? Talk to us.", "1156.34": "Second point is do a financial fast because when you have a limited amount of money with you,", "1161.62": "you become that much more conscious and aware of how you spend.", "1164.66": "And to me, that is a very interesting process with yourself.", "1167.98": "And the last point, but not the least, is to have a conversation about finances with people you trust.", "1174.54": "And with that, I hope you learned something useful today and stay tuned.", "1178.54": "This whole month, we have a lot of content for money and relationship.", "1183.86": "See ya!", "1186.58": "Hey, I hope you learned something useful today and truly appreciate that you took time off", "1191.42": "to better your life with a financial coconut.", "1193.9": "Knowledge is that much more powerful and interesting when shared,", "1197.26": "debated and discussed.", "1198.82": "I hope you will share what you've gained with people you love and I want to hear from you.", "1202.98": "Give me some questions and help me along with building a community of financially savvy coconuts.", "1207.9": "I hope together we can fulfill our curious minds and our desire for clarity.", "1211.9": "Email me at thefinancialcoconut at gmail.com,", "1214.94": "message me on Facebook or join our community telegram group.", "1218.94": "I will do my best to address your questions in a future podcast series,", "1222.42": "especially if many people are concerned about the same topic.", "1226.26": "With that, have a great day ahead, stay tuned next week and always remember,", "1230.78": "personal finance can be chill, clear and sustainable for all.", "1256.26": "Transcribed by https://otter.ai"}}, {"id": "15", "title": "How To Get Through Financial Challenges With Your Partner", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8AJPx001YQ", "content": "This episode of The Financial Coconuts focuses on how couples can navigate financial challenges in their relationships.

into the budget?", "419.3": "Now, do you have a budget in that respect?", "421.3": "This budget is very important,", "423.3": "because when I first got married to my husband,", "426.3": "we're both earning very high income.", "428.3": "So we spend money like water, literally, literally.", "431.3": "And so at the end of the day, we're like,", "433.3": "what the, you know, how come we don't have money left over?", "436.3": "Although we are such high earners, right?", "438.3": "Yes, yes.", "439.3": "And then we look back at like, you know,", "441.3": "we're charging here, we're charging there.", "442.6": "We have the intent that, well, the salary will cover it.", "446.6": "Ah, so it's a lot of,", "448.6": "because there's a comfort in the high income,", "450.6": "and then you don't really track your expenses, right?", "452.6": "Correct.", "453.6": "You just hear spend, spend, there spend, spend.", "454.6": "Exactly.

know,", "472.9": "or maybe your transportation, your food, you know.", "476.9": "And then when it comes to the relationship, right,", "478.9": "it's, at this point in time,", "480.9": "it's not a committed relationship.", "482.9": "It's just coming together kind of thing.", "484.9": "But how much are you going to spend, like,", "486.9": "going out with your girlfriend or your boyfriend?", "488.9": "How much are you going to spend for anniversary?", "490.9": "You know, everybody celebrates anniversary,", "492.9": "even though they're not married yet.", "493.9": "It's quite cute, like, you know.", "494.9": "So when you talk about committed, right,", "496.9": "the difference is marriage,", "499.2": "pre-marriage and post-marriage, right?", "501.2": "Yes, yes.", "502.2": "But let me digress a little bit, right?", "504.2": "Many people say committed.", "506.2": "Now, are you prepared to spend the rest of your life", "508.2": "with this person?", "509.2": "That is another topic for another day.", "511.2": "That is a huge topic, right?", "513.2": "Yes, correct.", "514.2": "So if you are, and you think that,", "516.2": "okay, you're going to marry this person,", "518.2": "you know, and you're going to spend the rest of your life with,", "520.2": "now, that is another thing that we have to talk about.", "524.2": "What are some of the criteria?", "525.2": "But, you know, wait till Reggie come up with a topic.", "527.5": "But let's talk about money for now.", "529.5": "Yes, so you have to understand how much do you give?", "532.5": "Now, generally, in a lot of courtship, right,", "534.5": "we notice this,", "536.5": "we tend to buy a lot of things for the other party.", "538.5": "Yes, gifting, right?", "539.5": "Yeah, yeah.", "540.5": "So it's like, wow, I buy you this bag,", "542.5": "or I buy you, you know, I'm in love with this person,", "544.5": "so I spend more on food,", "546.5": "or I bring him or her to a nice place.", "548.5": "Yes.", "549.5": "So it's a form.", "550.5": "Now, is that rational?", "552.5": "Can you keep this going?", "554.5": "Yeah, it feels like you're just wearing a bigger head, right?", "556.8": "Correct.", "557.8": "You cannot handle this.", "558.8": "Correct.", "559.8": "So are you in a relationship for the relationship itself,", "561.8": "or are you in a relationship to buy the relationship?", "564.8": "To impress the other party.", "566.8": "And to impress, correct.", "567.8": "Does that make sense to you?", "568.8": "If it does not, it's okay,", "570.8": "because when I said that, a lot of people look at me like this,", "572.8": "you know, wide-eyed, bushy-tailed look, you know.", "574.8": "But what basically it means is this,", "577.8": "is that, you know, are you buying things", "579.8": "so that the person will be committed to this relationship?", "583.8": "Yes.", "585.1": "So you have to consider this very carefully, okay?", "587.1": "So in a committed relationship,", "589.1": "generally, right, you tend to want to test what is first.", "593.1": "I mean, before you commit to it, you test what is first.", "596.1": "Now, if you bring somebody shopping,", "598.1": "and the first thing the person points out is a $10,000 Gucci bag,", "603.1": "now you obviously know that, you know.", "605.1": "Alarm bells, ding, ding, ding.", "607.1": "Yeah, and so you have to be very careful.", "610.1": "So make sure you budget out properly for both.", "614.4": "And then after that, on top of that,", "616.4": "if you are going to go into this relationship,", "619.4": "you need a budget for weddings,", "621.4": "you need a budget for pregnancy,", "623.4": "you need a budget for PTO,", "625.4": "for, you know, buying whether second-hand or first-hand,", "629.4": "and, you know, a car if you need, you know, all these things.", "632.4": "So people don't talk about that generally.", "634.4": "Yes, exactly.", "636.4": "So I think we all can agree that the basis of, you know,", "640.4": "common ground is actually common discussion first.", "643.7": "So an open, safe discussion where we talk about all these different elements, right?", "647.7": "Yes.", "648.7": "What kind of advice do you have for, like, new couples?", "650.7": "You know, because most people when they first start,", "652.7": "they don't talk about money first.", "653.7": "Correct.", "654.7": "You know, it's always have fun, right?", "655.7": "Here, go here, makan, makan, then there, watch movie, movie.", "657.7": "Yes.", "658.7": "And then after that, when they kind of feel that things are going to get serious,", "661.7": "or we're going to, like, consider co-living, you know,", "664.7": "sharing a space first before, you know, actually signing marriage and PTO,", "668.7": "all this kind of stuff,", "670.0": "then people start to have that generally difficult conversation around money.", "674.0": "Yes.", "675.0": "So what kind of advice do you have for new couples to embark on this conversation?", "680.0": "Okay, so as we real estate languages, you know, location, location, location.", "685.0": "Now, with relationship, it's communicate, communicate, communicate.", "689.0": "Yeah, so what does that mean?", "691.0": "Sometimes you need to have that real talk,", "694.0": "meaning that you need to sit down and once both of you are saying,", "698.3": "look, I'm committed, I want to bring the relationship from courting to engagement to marriage, right?", "707.3": "You seriously need to sit down and number one, again, do a budget.", "712.3": "Okay, why is this budget important?", "714.3": "Because it gives you an overview of how much you can afford on both sides.", "720.3": "There are some realities, right?", "721.3": "Yeah, correct.", "722.3": "So you would say, you know, like Christian would say, you know,", "725.6": "God provides, CS God will provide, but you still need to put the work in kind of thing, you know.", "729.6": "But you also need to say like, okay, now what happens if something happens?", "733.6": "Yeah.", "734.6": "Okay, so I won't go into that for now.", "736.6": "So budget is one thing and I need to communicate also with each other.", "740.6": "Do you plan to buy a flat?", "743.6": "Do you plan to stay with your in-laws?", "746.6": "Now I have couples that say, let's save some money and stay with the in-laws first.", "752.6": "No problem.", "753.9": "Which side?", "754.9": "Stay in the girl's side or the boy's side?", "757.9": "You know, then you need to really like, communicate.", "760.9": "All these are that kind of conversation.", "762.9": "Exactly.", "763.9": "So money is just one little thing in the relationship.", "766.9": "There are a lot of other things to consider about.", "769.9": "Number three is that what happens if, okay, if you decide to have children?", "775.9": "Yes.", "776.9": "How many children do you want?", "777.9": "One, two, three?", "780.2": "And during that period, your wife will obviously, by that time, may not have an income or she may quit.", "788.2": "Or she may go on maternity leave.", "790.2": "How long is a maternity leave?", "792.2": "How long is she going to take time off?", "794.2": "Or is she going to quit her job to look after the children full time?", "797.2": "This you need to consider.", "799.2": "Right now when I say it, it sounds very simple.", "802.2": "But I will tell you when it comes to it, there will be a lot of fire going around.", "806.5": "So, you know, you talk about all these different elements of finance that as a couple we need to talk about.", "812.5": "But can you share with us a little bit more about what are some of the relationship aspects?", "818.5": "You know, when we are trying to have this conversation, being a good converser, someone that is a good conversationalist, someone that is good at conversing.", "826.5": "There are some basic elements, especially to talk about these kind of stuff.", "830.8": "What are some of these elements that you can give us some advice on?", "833.8": "How to be someone that is very capable of discussing these kind of topics?", "838.8": "Okay, so obviously, you know, we need to have expectations.", "843.8": "We need to make aware of each other's expectations.", "847.8": "Be mindful not to be emotional about things.", "850.8": "Now, I will tell you as a woman, right?", "852.8": "Let's use the first case where after you marry, you want to stay with the in-laws to save some money first.", "860.1": "And then generally, I say generally, the girl will say, I stay with my parents because I am the daughter.", "869.1": "Now, would you as the husband be prepared to do that?", "874.1": "Now, if you do, then you set boundaries around it.", "878.1": "Okay, meaning that this is our room. No one is intruding into our room.", "883.4": "And if there are any issues with the in-laws, for example, if you are staying with your wife's parents,", "889.4": "if there are issues with the wife's parents, you as a husband do not go and quarrel with the wife's parents.", "897.4": "Because you are not quarreling with two people, you are quarreling with the whole tribe.", "902.4": "Ah, because you are actually staying at their place now, right?", "906.4": "Correct.", "907.7": "And then another thing that you need to be aware of is how long are you going to stay there for?", "914.7": "Because unfortunately, people get comfortable in an uncomfortable situation too.", "922.7": "So, you need to talk to your wife.", "924.7": "Let's say we are talking about you living with your wife's parents now, right?", "928.7": "You need to say how long are we going to stay there for?", "931.7": "How much are we going to save?", "932.7": "That's why the budget thing comes into place.", "935.0": "How much do you need to save to set aside so that you can either A. apply for BTO or B. get another place?", "944.0": "So, essentially there are three elements, right?", "946.0": "We don't want to be too emotional. That's the first thing.", "949.0": "Number two is we need clear boundaries in whatever that we do together.", "953.0": "Especially when you stay in your in-laws' place.", "955.0": "You need very clear, right? Tell your in-laws, everyone, you know.", "959.0": "And the third one is to have a plan to go ahead forward together.", "963.3": "Correct.", "965.3": "And then communicate with each other what your plans are.", "969.3": "Don't be so secretive about it.", "971.3": "I don't want to surprise her with a four-bedroom and she might hate the place or whatever.", "976.3": "We do have couples like that surprisingly.", "979.3": "So, it's like big major things you need to have discussion.", "983.3": "So, try not to say like, oh, she doesn't need to know or he doesn't need to know.", "988.3": "This is a big no-no at all.", "991.6": "And then both of you need to go and see a financial planner in terms of like", "995.6": "how do you save some money or maybe the gap that's required to get you off to a new place.", "1006.6": "So, case in point, my husband and I, right?", "1010.6": "I'll tell you this. We've been married for 26 years together for 37 years together since 17 years old.", "1017.6": "Wow, it was the first one?", "1019.6": "Yes.", "1020.9": "Wow, okay. That is very cool.", "1022.9": "We went through a lot and I tell you a lot, I meant a lot.", "1025.9": "So, recently we are looking at getting a place of our own.", "1030.9": "That's nice.", "1031.9": "So, a HDB, you know, resale one and so on and so forth.", "1034.9": "And we think in our head, right?", "1037.9": "When we went to Google to research, right?", "1039.9": "Oh, how much does a flat cost?", "1041.9": "You know, is it three bedrooms, two bedrooms?", "1043.9": "You know, where the location is, so on and so forth, right?", "1047.2": "But never did we know that there were things like grants,", "1051.2": "there were things that, you know, the gap that we didn't know that,", "1054.2": "the gap meaning that, you know, the deposit we need to put in,", "1057.2": "if our CPF is not sufficient, you know, and so on and so forth.", "1060.2": "And when we actually went to speak to a proper real estate agent slash CPF expert, right?", "1066.2": "She basically told us that some of the things we can do, some of the things we can't do.", "1071.2": "So, as a result of that, right?", "1072.2": "We say, oh, now we have a gap of so much money that we need to save.", "1077.2": "And so, how much time do we need to save this money?", "1081.2": "Yeah.", "1082.2": "So, after having the conversation, you definitely recommend to seek professional help, right?", "1086.2": "Correct.", "1087.2": "Depending on what vertical you are trying to achieve, whether is it retirement together", "1092.2": "or whether is it like getting a house together, always seek professional help.", "1096.2": "Yes.", "1097.2": "And I also want to tell you that, you know, if despite our long-term relationship", "1101.2": "that in front of this person, right?", "1103.2": "This real estate agent slash CPF, a financial planner, right?", "1107.2": "I actually argue with my husband.", "1109.2": "Okay, because he was saying like, you know, we need so many square foot, so wide a square foot.", "1115.2": "And I'm like, no, I don't need this.", "1117.2": "I need this room.", "1118.2": "I need this room to have en suite.", "1120.2": "So, there you go.", "1121.2": "It's not just a matter of money.", "1123.2": "It's also expectations as well.", "1125.2": "Yes.", "1126.2": "So, you both need to, the word is compromise, but I tend not to use the word compromise", "1130.2": "because compromise, somebody got to lose something.", "1133.5": "Basically.", "1134.5": "There's always this idea that when you compromise, you're actually giving up something.", "1137.5": "Yeah.", "1138.5": "So, my suggestion is to say, okay, can both of us come together and agree that, you know,", "1143.5": "I can have a bit of me in that house and I can have a bit of him in that house.", "1148.5": "What people would call common ground these days.", "1151.5": "Yes.", "1152.5": "So, this is one thought.", "1154.5": "Yeah.", "1155.5": "That's cool.", "1156.5": "And you know, in our pre-interview discussion, right?", "1158.5": "We talked quite a bit about how money is not actually the issue.", "1162.8": "Yes.", "1163.8": "Right.", "1164.8": "I mean, like just now we were going through all these pointers, which are great pointers,", "1166.8": "but you realize that ultimately there's a lot of more emotional elements around it, right?", "1171.8": "Yes, absolutely.", "1172.8": "You yourself have told me time and time again that, you know, it's not about the money.", "1175.8": "It's about the relationship and emotional attachment to money, you know, that it's very, very challenging to work with.", "1182.8": "So, can you like share with us a little bit more about all these kind of emotional attachment?", "1186.8": "How does that work?", "1188.1": "Okay.", "1189.1": "So, personally, if you say that I have zero emotions attached to money, that's a lie.", "1196.1": "Everybody will have emotional attachment to the money.", "1200.1": "Yes.", "1201.1": "But your emotions will be even, you know, it will raise even higher when you have lack of money.", "1209.1": "Put it this way.", "1210.1": "Fair.", "1211.4": "You know, we have couples that, you know, either the husband made redundant and decide to go into business for himself.", "1219.4": "And then the wife is working.", "1220.4": "Okay.", "1221.4": "Example.", "1222.4": "So, there was no timeline of whether this business will take off or when he is going to get a next job.", "1229.4": "Okay.", "1230.4": "So, I'm just using this for the husband scenario.", "1233.4": "So, the wife is working, working like crazy kind of thing.", "1237.4": "But the more she works, at first she was very supportive of him.", "1240.7": "She said, yeah, okay, honey, you know, yes, go and try, you know, you make a good entrepreneur.", "1246.7": "This is another topic that we will talk about later on.", "1249.7": "Entrepreneurship is not sexy, okay.", "1252.7": "It's extremely hard.", "1254.7": "It's extremely, it's like, oh my gosh, it's like, you know, it's just very difficult.", "1258.7": "And so, the husband, off he goes and do his own thing, register business and so on and so forth.", "1264.7": "But then as time goes on, right, suddenly their savings are depleted.", "1270.0": "Because you need to keep pumping money into the business.", "1272.0": "Yes, you got to upkeep all these things, right?", "1274.0": "Yes.", "1275.0": "Correct.", "1276.0": "So, what happened was that, you know, the wife start getting more and more resentful.", "1280.0": "Yeah.", "1281.0": "Because expectations and reality set the difference.", "1286.0": "Now, if you say there's no emotional attachment, no, because from, let's say, when husband and wife were working and they earn, say, between $7,000.", "1294.3": "Right, so once the husband lost his job, right, it goes down to say $3,500.", "1300.3": "Yeah.", "1301.3": "Okay.", "1302.3": "Lifestyle changes.", "1303.3": "Lifestyle changes.", "1304.3": "Cannot afford to eat anymore, to go out to eat more.", "1306.3": "You know, gone were the days when you can eat pangseh tatar, you know, big crab in jumbo.", "1310.3": "Now, you say, no, let's go kopitiam, eat the 68 gram one, you know.", "1314.3": "So, like, there's this resentment that keeps building.", "1318.3": "You can say, well, you know, wife need to be supportive.", "1321.6": "Yeah, I agree.", "1322.6": "I agree that wife need to be supportive.", "1324.6": "However, as women, now I speak from the perspective of women, we want to be secure.", "1328.6": "We want to feel secure.", "1329.6": "We don't want to be like, you know, say, we work and then there is this little naggy feeling that when will we be the next to lose our job?", "1339.6": "And if we lose our job, will we lose our home?", "1342.6": "And if we lose our home, what happened to our kids?", "1345.6": "What happened to, you know, the school fees and so on and so forth?", "1348.6": "Fair, fair.", "1349.6": "Right.", "1350.9": "So, there is this emotional thing that's happening.", "1353.9": "It's the roller coaster thing.", "1355.9": "So, what do you need to do?", "1356.9": "So, the solution is this.", "1358.9": "You need to give yourself timeline.", "1360.9": "Okay.", "1361.9": "Again, a clear timeline.", "1362.9": "Yes, that's right.", "1363.9": "Clear plan.", "1364.9": "So, if a husband is made redundant, for example, or, you know, want to go into the business.", "1369.9": "Now, be clear.", "1371.9": "Let's start with the redundancy first.", "1373.9": "Okay, the scenario of redundancy.", "1375.9": "How long are you going to keep looking for a job for?", "1380.2": "Are you actively seeking a job?", "1382.2": "Are you actively out there networking people to give you opportunity to provide you a job?", "1388.2": "Three years?", "1390.2": "Five years?", "1391.2": "You know, so you must have that timeline.", "1393.2": "Because when the time comes, right, you know that the time is getting closer.", "1397.2": "You won't be nonchalant about it.", "1399.2": "You won't say, oh yeah, I wake up the next day, I still got time.", "1402.2": "You know, yeah.", "1404.2": "And the wife can see that you are actually doing something.", "1407.5": "So, she doesn't feel like this is an endless pit.", "1410.5": "Ah, so that provides her that kind of security and affirmation that, you know, actually the plan is being met.", "1418.5": "Correct.", "1419.5": "You know, like we are not just going in a cycle and hoping things work.", "1422.5": "Exactly.", "1423.5": "So, now let's go to the entrepreneur part of things.", "1425.5": "It's the same.", "1426.5": "Now, with the husband, right, obviously when you go into entrepreneurship, you need to know what you're going into.", "1433.8": "It doesn't mean you register business, you start, let's say, a training company, you're an entrepreneur.", "1438.8": "No, it's not like that.", "1440.8": "I personally am an entrepreneur.", "1442.8": "My company has been in existence for four years now, going to five years.", "1446.8": "We only just started making a profit four years on.", "1449.8": "Oh, congrats.", "1450.8": "So, can you imagine that the last four years prior to that, right, you know, I'm the person who started this business.", "1457.8": "My husband is like, oh, well, is it happening?", "1459.8": "Is it happening, kind of thing?", "1460.8": "Right.", "1462.1": "It is happening, but oh my goodness, you deplete your savings.", "1468.1": "And when you deplete your savings, then what?", "1470.1": "How are you going to replace it?", "1472.1": "Yes, definitely.", "1473.1": "So, again, you need to have clear guidelines and timelines.", "1476.1": "It's okay, I'm going to go into this business for X number of years, all right.", "1481.1": "I'm going to actively, again, network.", "1484.1": "I'm going to actively look for business.", "1486.1": "I'm going to actively this and that, so on and so forth, right.", "1489.1": "But don't go blindly into it.", "1491.4": "Partnership is not blind.", "1492.4": "Just put your big toe into the water and see whether it works or not.", "1495.4": "It does not.", "1496.4": "This is your life we're talking about.", "1498.4": "And don't tell me about passion.", "1500.4": "Because passion lasts a distance, but conviction lasts a lifetime.", "1505.4": "Impact line.", "1507.4": "Yeah.", "1508.4": "So, what I'm saying is this, your passion, can you be passionate when money is not there anymore?", "1512.4": "Can you be passionate when your co-founder or, you know, whoever is supposed to support you bail out?", "1519.7": "Will you still be passionate about what you're doing?", "1521.7": "Yeah.", "1522.7": "And then on top of that, your conviction means come hell, fire, high water, you continue to do whatever it takes.", "1530.7": "And that is the challenge of being an entrepreneur, right.", "1533.7": "And then that challenge would actually somehow be another challenge for the spouse of an entrepreneur.", "1539.7": "Exactly.", "1540.7": "You got to bring all these challenges back.", "1542.7": "And while you're doing your fight, your spouse have to, you know, kind of defend the fort.", "1547.7": "Yes.", "1549.0": "You got to make the family work.", "1550.0": "Correct.", "1551.0": "And then you definitely will have, you know, those kind of bedside conversation.", "1555.0": "Very challenging, very emotional.", "1557.0": "Correct.", "1558.0": "You know, you want to share some experiences that you have, you know, what kind of some of these challenging conversations.", "1563.0": "Okay.", "1564.0": "So, we have, I have a couple that came up and the truth of the matter is that actually money brings the, it brings people to emotional high and lows.", "1574.0": "Ah, okay.", "1575.0": "A lot more than other things generally.", "1578.3": "Because a lot of things can be solved by money, right?", "1580.3": "Yeah.", "1581.3": "Including like people say, you can't replace money with health kind of thing or you can't replace health with money.", "1587.3": "I can't get.", "1588.3": "But let's put it this way.", "1589.3": "If you have money, you get good vitamins and all these things, right?", "1593.3": "Correct.", "1594.3": "So, yes, health is important, but you need the source to supplement that.", "1598.3": "Yes, as long as we live in a capitalistic world, right?", "1601.3": "Money is the center of the talk.", "1603.3": "Correct.", "1604.3": "Okay.", "1605.6": "So, in this case, we have a couple that came and then it raised quite a lot of baggage from the past because the girl, the wife came from a poor family and they worked very, very hard to become middle class.", "1619.6": "Okay.", "1620.6": "Let's say, you know, so they live in a nice terrace house and good income and so forth.", "1626.6": "And the husband came from also not too bad background.", "1632.6": "So, the two of them come together.", "1634.9": "So, all is very nice and rosy when, you know, everything is working out well.", "1638.9": "When things are beautiful, right?", "1639.9": "Yes, correct.", "1640.9": "So, one day, the husband got made redundant from his job, high paying job.", "1643.9": "So, he decided to go into business for himself.", "1648.9": "And so, initially, the wife was saying like, oh, it's okay.", "1652.9": "You know, if worst case, we will just make do.", "1655.9": "Now, what does make do mean?", "1657.9": "Not clear.", "1659.9": "Not clear.", "1661.2": "So, then the husband said, okay, no problem.", "1664.2": "You know, since my wife is supporting me.", "1666.2": "So, this one year, one year, five years on, the business did not pick up.", "1671.2": "Wow.", "1672.2": "Okay.", "1673.2": "So, by that time, the wife is getting fed up because I said there was no guideline.", "1679.2": "There was no timeline.", "1680.2": "So, basically, it's saying like, you know, you need to support me.", "1683.2": "So, the conversation goes from like, honey, how is it going with your business?", "1687.2": "Oh, it's coming along.", "1688.2": "You know, it's coming along.", "1690.5": "Again, what does coming along mean?", "1692.5": "But what the wife is saying is there's no results.", "1695.5": "There's no, you know, contracts.", "1697.5": "There's no nothing.", "1698.5": "So, there's a little bit pockets of ad hoc activities here and there.", "1703.5": "And then it went from, honey, how is it going to, I think you should quit your business and get a job.", "1709.5": "Yeah.", "1710.5": "Okay.", "1711.5": "Because you have bills to pay, you know, and so forth.", "1714.5": "I have to call on my parents.", "1716.5": "Oh, my gosh.", "1717.5": "You know what I mean?", "1718.8": "What does that mean?", "1719.8": "Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.", "1720.8": "Yeah.", "1721.8": "In-laws are in the picture.", "1722.8": "Exactly.", "1723.8": "And then the parents, on the other hand, the wife's parents don't see what's happening with the couple.", "1729.8": "You see?", "1730.8": "Or they say, oh, yeah, you know, he's going into a business.", "1732.8": "Good for him.", "1733.8": "Oh, she's still got a job.", "1734.8": "Good for her.", "1735.8": "But what if she starts approaching the parents and say, well, we're in dire straits.", "1739.8": "We need some money from you.", "1741.8": "How would that impact on the manhood of the husband?", "1744.8": "Fair.", "1745.8": "Fair.", "1746.8": "Right.", "1748.1": "So, you know, you still have this kind of idea that you got to take care of the house.", "1751.1": "Correct.", "1752.1": "I'm the sole breadwinner.", "1753.1": "Although I feel that there is a movement towards equality.", "1755.1": "Of course.", "1756.1": "There's more and more women taking up the grant and everyone is like a shared, you know, equal way of managing the household.", "1762.1": "So, this is still quite traditional.", "1764.1": "Yeah.", "1765.1": "And then it went from, honey, how's it going to look?", "1769.1": "You need to get a job to like, I think you should just, you know, kind of like stop it and just go along.", "1775.1": "Just quit.", "1777.4": "Just quit whatever you're doing right now.", "1779.4": "Okay, I'm fed up.", "1780.4": "Okay.", "1781.4": "And eventually, you know what happened to them?", "1782.4": "They split up.", "1783.4": "Oh, wow.", "1784.4": "That is like the ultimatum, right?", "1787.4": "Correct.", "1788.4": "Yes.", "1789.4": "So, you can see that if you talk about financial emotions, right, I mean, emotional attention, this is what happens.", "1797.4": "Yeah.", "1798.4": "You need to be so careful that, you know, a lot of thought process need to go inside it.", "1804.7": "So, when these kind of things happen, right, it's sometimes, you know, it's very tough to straddle between being supportive and being critical as a spouse, right?", "1815.7": "Correct.", "1816.7": "It's like you want to support your husband, you want to support your wife to chase their dreams because you also hope that they will support you to chase your dreams, right?", "1825.7": "And then when there's all these financial realities that come in, right, what would be the dining table advice?", "1832.0": "You know, how do we make dining table conversations, right, impactful to, you know, to this kind of support but at the same time push them to check reality, you know, how things are going and you still have a family.", "1844.0": "Don't forget you're no longer individual.", "1846.0": "Yes.", "1847.0": "You know, we got to do this together.", "1848.0": "Okay.", "1849.0": "So, first and foremost, I always say this, right, you can plan for the future but you can't predict the future.", "1854.0": "However, you can prepare for it.", "1856.0": "Fair.", "1857.0": "Fair.", "1858.3": "Don't have the, when you're in a committed relationship, right, and or you start out as a newlyweds, okay, is to make sure that you make provision for rainy days.", "1869.3": "Okay.", "1870.3": "Now, you don't wait until rain then you can look for umbrellas, right?", "1873.3": "So, generally people will say, you know, financial gurus will say, look, you know, put aside three months salary kind of thing, right, for any ad hoc.", "1882.3": "Like, for example, this coronavirus thing that hit a lot of people.", "1886.3": "Yes.", "1887.6": "Same case, expect the worst.", "1890.6": "Yeah.", "1891.6": "But set aside some money and then make plans that, you know, when something happen, you're ready to, you know, you can activate that kind of thing.", "1901.6": "So, I'll give you one solution.", "1903.6": "Solution number one is this, when both of you are earning good income, right, you have three boxes.", "1908.6": "Now, I'm talking about three physical boxes or three accounts.", "1912.6": "Okay.", "1913.6": "Account number one is this, joint account.", "1916.9": "Now, every time you get paid, right, you put aside 10% of your salary.", "1920.9": "Okay.", "1921.9": "Okay.", "1922.9": "So, if you're earning $5,000, you put aside $500.", "1925.9": "Now, this before you pay your bills.", "1928.9": "Fair.", "1929.9": "Okay.", "1930.9": "Now, why I said that is this, because after you pay your bills, then nothing left, then you can have it saved, then left $0.05.", "1935.9": "That's not saving.", "1936.9": "Yeah.", "1937.9": "So, you set aside that, okay.", "1939.9": "So, 10% both from your husband and the wife.", "1943.2": "So, you set aside.", "1944.2": "Now, you cannot touch that money at all.", "1946.2": "Okay.", "1947.2": "Now, buying a Gucci bag or buying a car is not emergency.", "1950.2": "Okay.", "1951.2": "So, that is emergency funds.", "1952.2": "Yes, emergency.", "1953.2": "Okay.", "1954.2": "Okay.", "1955.2": "So, this is the thing, right.", "1957.2": "Box number two or account number two is where you pay your bills.", "1961.2": "So, in a sense like your mortgage, you know.", "1964.2": "Yeah, your PUB, all those kind of stuff.", "1966.2": "So, how much is, you know, 20, 30% of your income, you know, I think.", "1971.2": "Fair.", "1972.5": "Then, the third box is your individual box.", "1975.5": "Now, why I said this, right.", "1977.5": "Your individual box could be like 10% of your, you know, whatever balance kind of thing.", "1982.5": "Or you can give yourself allowance.", "1984.5": "Okay.", "1985.5": "So, that you can do whatever you want.", "1986.5": "Correct.", "1987.5": "Correct.", "1988.5": "So, imagine like you're gonna buy your wife an anniversary present, but it comes from a joint account.", "1991.5": "Not cool.", "1992.5": "Correct.", "1993.5": "That's what I'm saying.", "1994.5": "So, kind of like have that conversation and say how much do we give ourselves allowance.", "2001.8": "Now, don't be ridiculous and say I give myself $1000 allowance.", "2003.8": "Can I think, what is it?", "2005.8": "$500 a month or is it $200, is it $100?", "2008.8": "Up to you.", "2009.8": "You need to discuss that with each other.", "2011.8": "Now, when I first started with my husband on this three boxes thing,", "2016.8": "we actually give ourselves, first time we did the first allowance was $100 a month.", "2020.8": "And then, because my husband got $100, so he spent the whole $100 for the whole month.", "2025.8": "Then, he got nothing.", "2026.8": "He spent it within two days, by the way.", "2029.1": "So, he got 28 days that he has got no money to spend.", "2032.1": "And it was like, he said it was the toughest, toughest thing ever.", "2035.1": "Now, what is the lesson behind this?", "2037.1": "It's gratification.", "2039.1": "Instant gratification or delay gratification.", "2043.1": "If you master this gratification, you master your emotion over money.", "2048.1": "Very cool.", "2049.1": "Does that make sense?", "2050.1": "Makes sense.", "2051.1": "That's why people invest, that's why people save for the longer term future.", "2054.1": "Exactly.", "2055.4": "It got to a point where we actually have $100 each beginning of the month.", "2060.4": "And we can walk into a shopping center and still count $100.", "2064.4": "Without spending a single cent.", "2065.4": "So, that is like a habit cultivation process.", "2068.4": "Correct.", "2069.4": "You guys commit to each other in this way of managing money.", "2073.4": "Yes.", "2074.4": "It sounds like you encourage a mixed management strategy.", "2078.4": "There's always this discussion, do we manage individually or do we manage as a couple,", "2083.7": "everything together.", "2084.7": "Some people, they will have a joint fund and then they do everything from there.", "2089.7": "Some people will be like, you pay the housing, I pay the PUB.", "2093.7": "That kind of strategy.", "2095.7": "You are leaning more towards the joint kind of strategy.", "2099.7": "I mean, commitment is 100% from each person.", "2103.7": "It's not 50-50.", "2106.7": "I digress a little bit on the financial part.", "2109.7": "If you are in a committed relationship, being 100%,", "2113.0": "why is it 20-30%?", "2115.0": "See how it goes.", "2118.0": "There's no such thing as see how it goes in a relationship.", "2120.0": "You are in or you are out.", "2122.0": "If you are in, you do it with all about you and her or him.", "2130.0": "So, don't have small percentage here that we don't know.", "2134.0": "We don't know the future.", "2136.0": "Then work on it because problems will come and it's guaranteed.", "2140.3": "That probably is a sign of insecurity.", "2142.3": "Because you are not sure, you don't know where you want to go.", "2145.3": "So, you have this reservation.", "2147.3": "But directly or indirectly is not helpful.", "2151.3": "This is the table conversation.", "2153.3": "So, you plan that to have that and not be disturbed in a sense by people saying this and that.", "2161.3": "You got to be comfortable with each other's so-called plans.", "2166.6": "Don't go and seek advice from people who don't know anything.", "2170.6": "Or may not know your situation.", "2173.6": "So, what kind of advice or what kind of advices will you get all these couples to seek for yourself?", "2179.6": "Can they call you up?", "2181.6": "Of course, you know, welcome.", "2183.6": "And as I said, we are focused on the family mentors as well for marriage.", "2187.6": "So, whether you are preparing to get married or already in a marriage.", "2193.9": "I will advise this.", "2195.9": "It doesn't matter what state your marriage is.", "2198.9": "You always seek counsel and you always seek coaching.", "2202.9": "Now, the reason being is that there is no such thing as a perfect marriage.", "2205.9": "But there is such thing as happily ever after.", "2208.9": "What does happily ever after mean for you?", "2210.9": "Happily ever after means that you guys are not fighting to the point where you are throwing things at each other.", "2216.9": "You are secured in your relationship.", "2218.9": "No K-drama.", "2221.2": "No K-drama.", "2222.2": "You are secured with each other.", "2224.2": "It doesn't matter what the situation is.", "2227.2": "The both of you stand steadfast and not fighting with each other.", "2231.2": "Good.", "2232.2": "So, you don't have infighting basically.", "2235.2": "So, generally in a lot of relationships,", "2238.2": "when things get very hot outside of them,", "2241.2": "instead of coming together to fight the heat,", "2245.2": "they fight with each other.", "2247.5": "Ah, okay.", "2248.5": "So, then essentially that partnership and the support breakdown will become outright enemies.", "2253.5": "Correct.", "2254.5": "Then, there is no salvation point already.", "2256.5": "Exactly.", "2257.5": "And then caution also if you have children.", "2259.5": "They are watching what you do.", "2261.5": "Yes, I get it.", "2262.5": "They may not necessarily understand the whole emotional thing or the relationship dynamics.", "2269.5": "But they watch how daddy talks to mommy and mommy scolds daddy or throw things or whatever.", "2274.5": "They watch it.", "2275.8": "What they do is they actually pick up the same habits.", "2278.8": "So, if you talk about financial intelligence and emotions,", "2283.8": "this is a good cultivation for them from young.", "2286.8": "To say like, daddy, mommy give you pocket money.", "2288.8": "How much do you save?", "2289.8": "How do you save?", "2290.8": "Yes.", "2291.8": "Yes.", "2292.8": "You got to lead by example, right?", "2294.8": "Essentially.", "2295.8": "Yes.", "2296.8": "Make that a dining table conversation.", "2298.8": "I always tell people, we don't have enough conversation about money.", "2301.8": "Money is like this sacred thing.", "2303.8": "People don't talk about.", "2305.1": "We don't talk about how much we are paid.", "2306.1": "We don't talk about how much insurance we have.", "2307.1": "We don't talk about savings.", "2308.1": "We don't talk about investments.", "2309.1": "And to me, if we continue to keep money a taboo topic, we will not make progress.", "2314.1": "Exactly.", "2315.1": "And in this generation where, you know, I would say many of us are a sandwich generation these days.", "2323.1": "Because like, the older generation, like maybe those that are in the 60s, 70s,", "2328.1": "they grew up in an era where Singapore was relatively poor.", "2332.4": "Right?", "2333.4": "So even, no matter how well they excel, they will be like, you know,", "2337.4": "there are many amazing individuals working at the port, doing machinery and all those.", "2341.4": "But slowly after they phased out, right?", "2343.4": "And their income was never what was needed for today's lifestyle.", "2349.4": "So many of them are reliant on today's fam, couples.", "2352.4": "Exactly.", "2353.4": "Like parents of today, people in their 40s, 50s, 30s.", "2357.4": "You know, they are all stuck in this sandwich.", "2359.7": "What are some of your thoughts about sandwich generation?", "2361.7": "How do we do this?", "2363.7": "So personally, I have older parents.", "2368.7": "I personally don't have children, but I do have adopted children.", "2371.7": "In a sense that, you know, my god, children are my brother's kids.", "2374.7": "Yes, yes, yes.", "2375.7": "And age between 8 and 16.", "2379.7": "So two of them.", "2380.7": "Okay.", "2381.7": "So I find that, for example, you know, they may not be my kids,", "2387.0": "but I feel for them.", "2389.0": "I actually feel for them.", "2391.0": "So like when my parents, some of the provisions you need to make, right?", "2395.0": "For young couples, while you're still young, your parents are young.", "2398.0": "Yes, that's true.", "2399.0": "Okay.", "2400.0": "So meaning that if you're in your 20s or 30s, your parents may be 50s or 60s.", "2404.0": "Yes.", "2405.0": "Okay.", "2406.0": "Now, I would encourage you to go and get insurance.", "2409.0": "Okay.", "2410.0": "I'm sorry, I'm not an insurance agent.", "2411.0": "You don't sell insurance yet.", "2412.0": "I know, I know.", "2413.0": "I'm just saying that, you know, this was exposed to me.", "2415.0": "Fair.", "2416.3": "Because when it comes to the part where when they get older, right?", "2420.3": "And you yourself included, right?", "2422.3": "You don't know what's going to happen.", "2423.3": "Yeah.", "2424.3": "Yeah.", "2425.3": "So when I was looking after my parents, so my mom passed away two years ago now.", "2428.3": "So and it cost $30,000, $40,000 to look after the last two years of her life.", "2433.3": "Wow, that is significant.", "2435.3": "So if not for the fact that she was a pioneer generation,", "2438.3": "which thank God that, you know, there's this pioneer scheme, right?", "2441.3": "So we don't fork out a lot, but it's still in the thousands of dollars.", "2444.3": "Yes, yes.", "2445.6": "So the insurance that we prepare, right?", "2448.6": "Help to actually defray some of the costs.", "2451.6": "Yeah, defray some of the costs.", "2452.6": "And also, you know, don't forget that all these things are also affecting your marriage,", "2456.6": "your relationship as well, kind of thing, you know?", "2459.6": "And then the other thing is that for children, right?", "2462.6": "It's the same.", "2463.6": "Take out insurance for them too.", "2465.6": "You know, if there are things you cannot do for yourself, get somebody who can help you to do.", "2471.6": "Yes.", "2472.9": "You believe in long-term planning.", "2474.9": "You believe in preparing early, right?", "2477.9": "So let's say I'm a couple, right?", "2480.9": "And we just got married, right?", "2482.9": "And at what stage should we then talk about like supporting our parents?", "2487.9": "Should it be like before marriage?", "2489.9": "Or, you know, at that point in time, people are not very interested to talk about supporting parents, right?", "2492.9": "They're talking about their house, building their own dream.", "2494.9": "Yes, yes.", "2495.9": "You know, and I think a lot of my friends have these conversations at this point in time.", "2500.2": "Because we are like late 20s, early 30s, income is stable, and then family is aging,", "2505.2": "and everyone is discussing that.", "2506.2": "When should we start supporting the family?", "2509.2": "Okay.", "2510.2": "And what are your thoughts?", "2511.2": "Well, it's a topic very close to my heart, to be very honest with you.", "2516.2": "And I'm quite somber about that.", "2518.2": "Because I felt that, you know, supporting your parents should not be when you grow up kind of thing.", "2525.2": "You should be supporting your parents, whether it's financially, emotionally, mentally.", "2529.5": "You know, even physically in a sense, like, you know, visiting them.", "2533.5": "While you're pursuing your dream, now, again, you know, I throw a caveat on that dream word.", "2539.5": "Okay.", "2540.5": "Are you going into a dream of knowing where you're going or are you into a nightmare?", "2545.5": "Yeah.", "2546.5": "Okay.", "2547.5": "So, the truth of the matter is whether you set aside some money, take out insurance for them,", "2552.5": "or, you know, all this will be up to you.", "2555.5": "Individually first before the commitment.", "2558.8": "And then when you're committed or, you know, engaged or marriage kind of thing,", "2564.8": "you need to be open about what you're doing for your parents.", "2569.8": "Okay.", "2570.8": "Yeah.", "2571.8": "Support doesn't mean, oh, well, I just go and see them and, you know, I'm done.", "2576.8": "I'm done supporting.", "2577.8": "This was my case many years ago because I was living overseas with my husband for 27 years.", "2584.1": "And every time I fly in and out of Singapore, right, I'll just have a meal with my parents.", "2590.1": "And my thought process was I've already done my duty as a daughter.", "2594.1": "How wrong was I?", "2596.1": "Okay.", "2597.1": "How wrong was I?", "2598.1": "Because I realized that, you know, with each passing day, they get older and older.", "2602.1": "Right.", "2603.1": "And then as it law, when I came back, my husband and I came back in 2016, right, to Singapore", "2608.1": "to come back home, basically, because of our aging parents.", "2613.4": "I thought that, you know, I'm going to have like, say, 5, 10, 15 years with my parents.", "2619.4": "But within two years, my mother passed away.", "2621.4": "Yeah.", "2622.4": "Yeah.", "2623.4": "So it goes to show that you cannot, you know, you cannot tell whether it's a kind of long-term planning kind of thing.", "2630.4": "However, as I said, you can't predict the future, but you can prepare for it kind of thing.", "2634.4": "So the suggestion is that this is my personal suggestions, but it'd be up to, you know, couples to decide what's comfortable for them.", "2642.7": "Right.", "2643.7": "Do you want to take out insurance for them?", "2645.7": "Do you want to put aside some money for them?", "2647.7": "And if you put aside some money for them, how much is too much?", "2650.7": "How much is too little?", "2651.7": "You have to decide kind of thing.", "2653.7": "Yes, we are not all earning 5, 6, 7 thousand dollars a month kind of thing.", "2657.7": "Yes, yes.", "2658.7": "But it is still possible.", "2660.7": "It is still possible.", "2662.7": "So you have to decide between the two.", "2665.7": "You don't become a contentious issue.", "2668.0": "I understand that you two will become old one day and your children will have to make the same decision as you do now.", "2676.0": "Fair, fair.", "2677.0": "If not, it will be even tougher next time down the road because of the inflation

fundamentals to human progress.", "384.0": "But honestly, when we look across the board within the world or within the region,", "390.2": "I dare say the life of an average Joe, which is the mass of us in Singapore, is way better", "397.0": "than anyone else within the region.", "399.4": "Of course, if you want to do business, you want to be different, you want to be unconventional,", "403.28": "then that is like a whole topic in itself.", "406.4": "But when you look at it, most people don't make $10,000 a month.", "410.52": "They never come close individually, and it is fine.", "414.92": "They live a very happy and comfortable life in general, okay?", "419.72": "We all have our episodes of issues, but when we drag it long enough, it is fine.", "426.04": "Which brings me to my very first point, why you will never make $10,000 a month.", "431.44": "It is because only about 1% to 2% of Singaporeans make such income.", "435.84": "And yes, how do I get this statistics?", "437.84": "Honestly, there is no outright stats in online that you can find.", "443.48": "No report really tells you what is the breakdown, how many percent of people make $10,000,", "447.56": "how many percent of people make less than that, and what is the spread across.", "451.96": "But there is this one report that I found, written by Mr Tan Ern Sir of LKY School of", "458.64": "Public Policy, titled Class and Social Orientations, Key Findings from the Social Stratification", "465.76": "Survey 2011.", "468.6": "So please go and Google and go and find it.", "470.72": "This guy did a survey with 2,700 people in Singapore.", "474.52": "Of course, it is not super reflective of the market, but this is at best of what I", "479.08": "can find and I hope that there are more studies around it.", "482.16": "And statistically, if you look at it, only 1% of household, based on his 2,700 PECS study,", "489.72": "only 1% of household make more than $20,000 a month.", "495.4": "So if I'm assuming that in this household, there are only two people that makes money,", "500.16": "and they make an even number, that is about only 1% that makes $10,000 a month.", "506.88": "But you factor in all these kind of standard deviation, let's give it maximum 3% of Singaporeans", "512.72": "make such income.", "514.8": "So yeah, like I said, you want to set good goals, you want to set goals that drive you,", "520.04": "but these kind of audacious goals, that means you're trying to tell me that amongst 100", "524.56": "people in Orchard Road, you are the top 3.", "527.56": "I honestly find it very challenging if most of us are doing what everyone else is doing,", "533.52": "and we want to rise above the rest, then that is extremely questionable.", "537.72": "It's like you telling me that you want to grow a sunflower, both of you use the same", "541.8": "seed, same soy, same fertilizer, same amount of water, water at the same time, and you", "546.56": "expect your sunflower to grow bigger.", "548.4": "Alamak, how does that work, right?", "550.28": "So I'm not discerning you, I'm not telling you that you shouldn't strive for the goals", "555.8": "that you want to go for, but statistically, it is like an avalanche, it is like a tsunami,", "560.96": "it is very challenging.", "562.64": "So if you want to go for your $10,000 a month income, by all means, do it.", "566.76": "But you got to realize that it is virtually impossible.", "570.4": "I would say it's virtually impossible, because I can easily name like 30, 50 people that", "574.48": "I think are doing a much greater job than me providing value to society and to their", "579.8": "corporation and whatever that they do.", "582.56": "So when I look at it, it's like, okay, then I'm fine, because we need to realize that", "587.24": "wealth accumulation is income surplus compounded over time, which means every month you save", "593.68": "a little bit, you gather a little bit, in due time, you will become very wealthy.", "597.76": "And everyone else in the market is trying to sell this Amazon course, trying to sell", "601.64": "you that stock picking course, it's just trying to tell you to increase your income or optimize", "606.72": "a certain element of it.", "609.16": "But the reality is, the basis is you need income surplus.", "612.8": "As long as you make more than you spend, in due time, you become very wealthy.", "617.76": "There's no secret to this.", "619.56": "So don't need to be too emotional and desperate to make $10,000 a month.", "626.12": "It is okay, my friends.", "628.28": "Which brings me to the number two point, is that the labor market, it is governed by demand", "636.0": "and supply factors.", "638.4": "I think these days, many people understand a little bit of demand and supply.", "642.24": "I mean, I go to the wet market, the auntie can tell me, inflation, inflation,", "646.88": "you know, \u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0.", "648.76": "So I'm assuming everyone kind of knows a little bit about demand and supply.", "653.32": "But I think many of us conveniently forgot that even in the labor market, there is a", "658.12": "demand and supply.", "660.28": "Remember the days when engineers were paid very, very well?", "663.4": "Remember the days when bankers were paid very, very well?", "666.28": "Remember the days when air stewardess were paid very well?", "669.08": "Remember the days when designers were paid very well?", "671.44": "And today, coders are paid very well because there is a huge demand and a lack of supply.", "676.96": "That is kind of how it is.", "678.92": "Of course, there are a lot of nuances in this whole dynamic.", "683.04": "And we talked about this in episode two, one of the earlier episodes, which the audio quality", "687.92": "not as good.", "688.92": "But anyway, content is still pretty good.", "691.96": "So we talk about paycheck realities.", "693.68": "Essentially, you may be doing administrative work in a legal firm compared to you doing", "698.76": "administrative work in F&B.", "701.32": "It's different because the industry cannot afford to pay you.", "703.92": "Of course, that is a whole new level of discussion in itself.", "708.16": "But there is a general broad market sentiment.", "711.48": "In the past, when there were not enough engineers, engineers were paid very, very well.", "715.68": "So when we look at today, it is because the coders are in short supply.", "720.6": "And that's why everyone is paid very well.", "722.68": "At least for most of the coders that I know.", "725.2": "And honestly, many of them don't really care about finances at this point in time.", "728.96": "Because if you think about it, you just graduated or you've studied and you come out, you graduate.", "734.36": "Suddenly, you make 5, 6, 7, 8 thousand.", "736.8": "Some of those coders, they do make that kind of numbers right from the university, right", "740.76": "after they come out.", "741.76": "They have done some projects before.", "743.12": "They've done their internship.", "744.12": "They've gone to some of the biggest companies.", "746.0": "They make 8 thousand a month straight away.", "747.68": "I know a friend who is working for Microsoft.", "749.32": "I think they're paying him like 10 thousand or 11 thousand.", "753.8": "But he's in the US.", "755.8": "By the way, you realise that coders, they suddenly make this kind of money.", "759.6": "So they don't really bother planning.", "761.32": "To them, it's like, oh, I barely spend as much.", "764.68": "They're always in surplus.", "766.52": "But the reality is, my friends, if you're a coder, you've got to realise that demand", "770.88": "supply factors will catch up with you.", "773.8": "More and more people are going to computing.", "775.44": "I remember those days when I was in university, or for however short time that I was in university,", "781.16": "the School of Computing was like a straight C course.", "783.92": "If you get CCC and you want to apply to NUS, NUS will offer you computing.", "791.76": "And today, it is a straight A program.", "793.48": "Tons of people want to come into the program and I'm expecting the government and governments", "798.12": "all around the world to expand computing courses, to put more funding into educating, to develop", "805.08": "coders.", "806.08": "So in due time, the supply will catch up and, you know, your pay may come down.", "811.84": "But for all of us who are like not coders and currently do not enjoy the perks, you", "817.76": "know, of making that kind of high income because of the situation, it is okay, guys.", "823.96": "We all can do very, very well over time.", "828.08": "We need to realise that most of these people that are very wealthy have accumulated wealth", "833.12": "over generations and generations.", "836.8": "So no hurry.", "838.44": "More often than not, when we are in a hurry, there is underlying insecurity and we need", "843.32": "to solve that, right?", "844.84": "It's not exactly about financials.", "847.96": "But yes, time to time, we have cash flow issues, but it is not a long term financial challenge.", "853.08": "So let's continue to learn more about finance and see how we can then strive for a better", "859.08": "life.", "860.08": "So it brings me to my third point of why you will almost never make $10,000 a month and", "866.08": "it is okay.", "867.08": "It is because there is a global job market today.", "872.4": "In the past, most people, they work and, you know, your competition is like on the left", "877.92": "of you, on the right of you in a university or out there in the labour market.", "881.52": "That's about it.", "882.52": "But today, there are like telework, there's like outsourcing.", "885.88": "There are tons of kind of different arrangements when it comes to work because of the global", "892.0": "job market, because of internet, because of the way we do things today, you know, less", "897.16": "and less labourers and more and more thought based.", "901.76": "So with internet, with technology, with the thinking economy, you know, more and more", "906.44": "of us, most of us are getting challenged globally and everyone around is trying to come to Singapore,", "913.76": "honestly, because you make a lot of money relatively to where you come from.", "919.48": "I'm not sure if you heard but there are tons of stories of professionals, university grads", "924.84": "from the Philippines, from Pakistan, from Bangladesh, from India, they come here and", "929.8": "they're willing to take like a smaller job.", "933.0": "You know, let me say, they come to Singapore to get underemployed.", "936.6": "Yes, they come to Singapore to get underemployed and even under underemployed kind of circumstances,", "943.72": "they make way more than whatever they do in their own country.", "949.36": "So when you look at that, because the global job market, it is so interconnected, many", "955.72": "of us will never break through that kind of income.", "958.4": "In fact, there may be a downtrend in terms of the incomes that we're going to make if", "962.72": "we don't keep up with the times.", "966.4": "But all that being said, I'm not here to scare you, you know, we can continue to learn and", "970.48": "upgrade and work on ourselves so that we can continue to raise our income over time.", "976.08": "The whole idea why I'm doing this episode is because I don't want you to be suffering", "980.84": "from all these kind of audacious goals.", "983.0": "I don't want you to feel like you're not enough because you don't make $10,000 a month.", "987.64": "I don't want you to feel that there is, you know, like the future is bleak because the", "992.24": "future is super bright.", "995.28": "Honestly I'm not like, I don't love Singapore altogether.", "999.08": "There are things that I think needs to be better, like how the housing scheme conveniently", "1004.92": "removes all the single people until they're 35.", "1009.0": "So by the time you're 35, you're like, you know, not as exciting and you may not get", "1015.48": "your partner, then you finally get a HDB for some reason.", "1021.04": "And I don't think we, I think we need to move towards gender equality.", "1024.76": "I think we need to work on a more accountable kind of structure with CPF.", "1030.56": "But honestly, if you look at Singapore, it is amazing.", "1034.36": "We have done a pretty good job.", "1036.24": "I don't think the ruling people have done such a bad job.", "1039.76": "Honestly, they've done a pretty good job relative to the region.", "1043.56": "It's always relative, right?", "1044.92": "You look at your neighbours, actually my garden not bad, compared to my neighbour.", "1049.4": "So when we look at it, there are pros and cons living in different places.", "1053.52": "So objectively, in Singapore, you are pretty alright if you follow the narrative.", "1059.0": "You are pretty alright if you follow the narrative.", "1061.24": "And if you really want to make $10,000 a month, chances are you need to fall out from the", "1065.76": "narrative.", "1066.76": "You need to like do other stuff.", "1068.36": "You need to run your own startup.", "1070.28": "You need to do your own business.", "1072.12": "You got to be like one of the top in whatever profession that you do.", "1076.6": "And if that is what you want, go for it.", "1078.36": "If that is what you want, go for it.", "1080.2": "I'm going to do another episode down the road to talk about some of these challenges as", "1085.28": "an entrepreneur.", "1086.28": "And I'm interviewing more entrepreneurs coming on the show.", "1088.68": "So that is going to be fun.", "1090.4": "But the takeaway message for today I'm going to share with you is that you are alright.", "1095.8": "You are fine.", "1096.8": "You are in good hands.", "1097.8": "No worries, guys.", "1098.96": "And so I'm going to sum up the day with the three reasons why you will never make $10,000", "1102.84": "a month and it is okay.", "1104.72": "Number one is because only about 1% to 3% of Singaporeans make such income.", "1109.24": "This is my prediction based on what I see from the study done by Mr. Tan En Seh.", "1114.48": "And number two is that the demand supply governs the skills market.", "1118.88": "And number three is that there is a global and increasingly global job market.", "1123.6": "So we are vying with global people in terms of the skill sets that we can provide.", "1128.72": "Ultimately, I want you to know that finance, personal finance is a much bigger topic than", "1135.08": "just income alone.", "1137.16": "Work on your expenses, work on your savings, accumulate your wealth and ultimately you", "1142.36": "will be able to get there like many other people have done before.", "1146.6": "I hope you learn something useful today.", "1148.28": "See ya!", "1149.28": "Hey, I hope you learn something useful today and truly appreciate that you took time off", "1154.72": "to better your life with the financial coconut.", "1156.84": "Knowledge is that much more powerful and interesting when shared, debated and discussed.", "1161.72": "I hope you will share what you've gained today with people you love and I want to hear from", "1165.44": "you.", "1166.44": "Send me your questions and help me along with building our community of financially savvy", "1169.64": "coconuts.", "1170.64": "I hope together we can fulfill our curious minds and our desire for clarity.", "1173.84": "Talk to me on Facebook or join our community telegram group.", "1177.48": "I will do my best to address your questions in a future podcast series, especially if", "1182.32": "many people are concerned about the same topic.", "1185.2": "With that, have a great day ahead, stay tuned next week and always remember, personal finance", "1190.64": "can be chill, clear and sustainable for all."}}, {"id": "17", "title": "3 Mindsets That Helped Me Become Financially Literate", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIzgFrMOU8M", "content": "In this podcast, the speaker talks about three key mindsets that have helped him become financially literate. The first mindset is that there is no best strategy without context, meaning that it's important to understand the situation before making decisions. The second mindset is that one must always make the best decision to their best knowledge, even if it means taking risks or making mistakes. Finally, the third mindset is the growth mindset, which focuses on continuous learning and improvement.", "transcript": {"0.0": "Good day guys! This is a special Tuesday because it's the first Tuesday that you are out of your home in a long long time.", "9.0": "It's a phase 2 of CB and I'm so stoked and so happy to be meeting my friends.", "15.0": "I hope you are doing well, I hope things get more settled down and I want us to continue to make progress towards a life we love.", "23.0": "And one thing that I feel we need to move towards a life we love is we need to recognize some certain mindsets that we have in our head.", "32.0": "Whether you call them mindsets, you call them scripts, you call them narrative, you know they are all implanted in your head through all sorts of medium.", "41.0": "Your parents, the media, society and all sorts of stuff.", "45.0": "They all guide us in our decisions to do a lot of different things.", "49.0": "And today I'm going to spend some time to share with you 3 mindsets that I hold close on my personal finance journey.", "63.0": "So good morning everyone! I welcome you to another day with The Financial Coconut.", "69.0": "In our podcast, we'll be debunking financial myths, discovering best financial practices and discussing financial strategies that fits our unique lives.", "77.0": "You get it! Ultimately empowering us to create a life we love while managing our finances well.", "83.0": "And today's topic, 3 mindsets that I hold close on my personal finance journey.", "93.0": "So during this CB period or whether it's your RMO in Malaysia, essentially during the lock-in phase where you are stuck at home, many people are creating content.", "103.0": "So that's interesting. We are seeing more and more voices on the internet, more and more viewpoints being paddled all around in the personal finance space and beyond.", "113.0": "So like it or not, everyone has their own viewpoints and they have a different way of life and different mindsets.", "119.0": "Essentially, all these mindsets, scripts, narratives, whatever you call them, influence our decisions on a subconscious level.", "127.0": "You're not always thinking about, oh what is my mindset? What kind of mindset do I hold?", "132.0": "But all these things that are in your head, within your system, they influence your decisions.", "138.0": "And one thing that I've observed that is very deeply ingrained in a lot of us, a lot of our mindsets, is the idea of save, save, save.", "146.0": "You should save. You should have savings. And savings is important.", "150.0": "So I mean, all the way from the PLSB squirrel, the smart saver program or young savers program since you are a kid where you can kind of put your coins into the machine.", "161.0": "I think that was like maybe in the 80s, 90s, a bit more popular. I'm not sure if they still have those.", "166.0": "And all the way to your parents giving you a piggy bank and encouraging you to save.", "171.0": "Little, little things that are actionable, but also impressionable.", "176.0": "Right? The media tells you saving is good. Your parents encourage you to form saving habits.", "181.0": "And even the banks create systems to encourage you to save.", "185.0": "So like it or not, it has been inbuilt into our system since young that saving is good because everyone say that saving is good.", "192.0": "You should save. You should save. You should save.", "194.0": "Imagine the banks since young tell you, you should invest. Investing is good.", "198.0": "Or you should learn how to spend. Spending is important.", "201.0": "And that will form a very different narrative.", "204.0": "So I do encourage parents out there to talk to your kids in a more varied manner.", "210.0": "It's not all about savings. You need to teach them how to spend.", "213.0": "Understanding the value of the things that they buy. Recognising the relativity of price.", "219.0": "And all these kind of stuff where we will touch on in later topics.", "223.0": "I'm getting there. I've read a whole book called Irrational.", "227.0": "Predictably Irrational. And I love that book. It talks a lot about spending.", "231.0": "I know in the Telegram group, I've already shared with some of you guys.", "234.0": "I'm going to kind of distill all the information and share with you some points as to why we spend in a certain way.", "240.0": "That's for later episode. But back to the idea of savings.", "244.0": "Many people have this ingrained idea, but they don't actually know why they need to save.", "249.0": "Or they don't objectively recognise the value of savings.", "252.0": "They are just governed by a certain mindset that is given to them since young.", "257.0": "So I've touched extensively on how much to save, what is the function of savings,", "263.0": "and all those kind of stuff. What are some of the better saving strategies objectively in the earlier episodes.", "269.0": "Definitely check those out. And I'm sure if you have been a constant listener, you hear me talk about this quite a lot.", "275.0": "So when you are fed these kind of mindsets, they govern our actions.", "280.0": "Over time, once you ingrain these mindsets that saving is good, saving is important,", "285.0": "you keep saving and saving and saving. Sometimes you don't know why, you take it too far.", "289.0": "So that is the same for many other different things.", "292.0": "Whether it is investing, why you only invest in bonds, or you don't buy, you are not in the stock market.", "299.0": "Because everyday you hear people, stock market very bad, we'll go bankrupt.", "302.0": "Lose a lot of money. So a lot of these kind of things, they get framed into your head,", "307.0": "they become ingrained mindsets. And I'm sure over the course of this podcast,", "312.0": "we've addressed a lot of these kind of mindsets and kind of revisit certain topics in a different angle.", "318.0": "So I hope that helps. But today I specifically want to share with you some of the mindsets that helped me to learn.", "324.0": "I think that is way more important, which is why I hold them very close on this journey.", "329.0": "But we all grew up in different environments, different households, and we have different mindsets.", "334.0": "And I'm not saying that my mindsets are better than yours, I'm just sharing with you some that I find valuable.", "340.0": "And also in this process, I hope to encourage you to revisit a lot of these kind of mental scripts", "346.0": "and mental mindsets that you have in your head that governs you in the way you spend, the way you invest,", "352.0": "the way you save, the way you treat relationships, the way you treat income, and all those different things.", "358.0": "So the very first mindset that I feel is important is there is no best strategy without context.", "368.0": "Allow me to fill you in with some context. Why do I put this as the very first mindset that I hold close to myself?", "376.0": "That is because I feel in all these forums and all these Facebook groups out there, which I am relatively active,", "385.0": "sometimes I look at it, sometimes I do my posts, and that's probably why you found me in the first place.", "390.0": "So cool stuff. But everyone is trying to tell you their strategy and everyone is trying to say that", "397.0": "they have the best strategy. Okay, maybe not everyone, but I see a lot of that.", "402.0": "You know, like, this is a better strategy, don't buy unit trusts, use robo-advisors, pick your own stocks,", "409.0": "learn to save in this way, use that credit card. Everyone is trying to tell you a certain strategy", "415.0": "and they are all trying to influence your thoughts.

Let's say we talk about picking stocks, right?", "429.0": "I know a lot of people recently have been asking me about picking stocks, or what stocks do I pick, what is my strategy?", "434.0": "And I'm sure you've used some stuff, right?

And actually,", "1361.76": "in my personal opinion, I think the gap is wider than that. And maybe that's because I come from", "1366.32": "the banking and financial services sector, where you tend to have, you know, a higher pay range.", "1371.52": "So again, it comes back to why that is so, right. I mean, even in Singapore, where, you know,", "1376.64": "we're so progressive, we're so developed, there's a lot of opportunities for women in Singapore,", "1381.36": "actually. But again, I think it comes down to that silent worker mentality, and, you know,", "1390.08": "not wanting to stand out, you know, and being the supportive role sometimes,", "1395.76": "which, you know, I think maybe a mindset needs to change around that. You know, for women,", "1400.56": "a lot of my friends, I say, you know, do you know how much you should be paid doing this role? You", "1404.8": "know, so many, so much research out there, if you go Google it, this position, this title,", "1409.68": "what is the median pay range? Go and check it out. How many times have you talked to your boss about", "1414.56": "a possible pay rise? You know, I'm very sure men do that a lot more, you know, and maybe they get", "1422.56": "headhunted as well, then they have a reference, and they say, oh, okay, somebody's offering me", "1426.0": "10% more. But, you know, if you really do well in what you do, don't be afraid, you know, and it can", "1432.4": "be something, an open conversation you can have, and maybe that is what is needed, because then,", "1436.24": "the boss, if you don't ask, you never get, right? And so that, I think, is one thing that maybe", "1442.32": "could be improved, yeah. But I would say that women, I mean, one point that Evelyn said was", "1450.4": "about, you know, taking time off, you know, or, you know, to start a family, have children, and", "1456.24": "that is very true. That is so true. You need the time, you want to spend the time with the,", "1460.8": "especially when you're young. But that doesn't mean you're less productive. I know so many women", "1465.68": "who work crazy hours, because after they've done everything for the kids, you know, cooking,", "1470.56": "cleaning, and everything, and putting them in bed, reading bedtime stories, and they go back,", "1474.72": "and they switch on their computer, and they just continue going on. And, you know, they make sure", "1478.8": "the presentation is perfect, you know, they want to get the job done, because they feel they need", "1483.52": "to compensate for the time that they're not in the office, you know, and they may have to leave early,", "1487.84": "but, you know, when I was working in the UK, I learned something. I was working till seven or", "1492.4": "eight o'clock one day, and my boss came up to me and said, are you okay? You know, what's wrong with", "1496.24": "you? Why are you the only one left in the office? That means you are not, are we giving you too much?", "1500.4": "Or, you know, are you, you know, he was actually looking at it as a point where I was not being", "1505.2": "efficient or productive. I'm not doing well, and therefore I had to stay late. But that is another,", "1510.08": "okay, that's maybe another different thing about, you know, perception again.", "1513.52": "Yeah, cultural perception.", "1514.4": "Cultural perception. Oh, you stay, oh, you go leave early, you leave at six o'clock,", "1517.84": "because you need to pick up the kids or whatever, then you are lazy. But this person actually tried", "1522.48": "to overcompensate, I think, you know, by doing it late at night, even over weekends, just to make", "1527.76": "sure that they can do it well. And so I feel that that's something that women, you know, also,", "1533.84": "you know, should, should, should recognise, you know, and, and their bosses as well, you know,", "1540.96": "hiring managers, as you say, Evelyn.", "1543.68": "Definitely.", "1544.32": "Yeah. So, so I just want to add on to what I mentioned earlier about the five things, you know,", "1549.44": "the PRIME kind of thing, because at the end of the day, stereotyping comes from misunderstanding", "1555.04": "also. Can I just say that? So in a sense that if you are like what Jeanette say, you know,", "1560.48": "you're good in what you do, be confident enough to step up and say, I can do this, I need to be", "1566.88": "paid this. So your self-esteem comes in, because a lot of us are like so afraid of, of saying", "1573.04": "things because of, we think we are not worth this much, therefore we dare not ask, you know,", "1578.32": "so why not ask? Like, I'll give you an example. When my company, previous company, I work at", "1584.0": "MNC, got taken over, right, merger acquisition process. There was this spot for me that, you", "1589.2": "know, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. And I was always been stereotyped as a personal assistant", "1594.64": "until, you know, the new CEO came and then he asked me, this is a brand new sheet of paper right now,", "1600.8": "where do you think you fit into this new company? You know, I put my hand up and I said, I want to do", "1605.84": "corporate affairs and I want to be head of corporate affairs. Now, and I was like, and he was", "1611.28": "like, okay, good. So what do you want to do? I said, I will craft up my roles and responsibilities.", "1617.52": "I will write it out what I want to do. Because after all, right, some of the roles and", "1622.32": "responsibilities are published in the newspapers, are copy and paste. It doesn't even make sense,", "1627.28": "you know, for a certain position. Why not carve out your own destiny in a sense in a company?", "1633.12": "As a woman, why not do that? Because we are very flexible, you know, we know the job. We don't", "1638.72": "just know the job, the functions of the job, but we know what entails in that job, the functions", "1643.76": "of the job, and how to relate to people. Women are by nature quite relatable, you know, and also", "1650.56": "the fact that, you know, we can have nurturing attitude. We can nurture the younger generations,", "1656.56": "you know, guide them through some storms of life. So this is where I think that if you talk about", "1661.6": "pay gender, you don't talk about payment for that sort of thing. People watch us. Sometimes our", "1666.88": "payments come in a form of endorsements, you know, accolades, you know, being recognized, may not", "1672.08": "necessarily be the actual financial payment. So this is very important to all the ladies out", "1680.4": "there or even men. Let's put it this way. We are all recognized for the talents we bring to the table.", "1685.92": "We're not recognized for, you know, the gender. We're not recognized for just being a woman or", "1690.4": "being a man. So that's my thought.", "1693.92": "So it does sound like you already moved past that view of like gender already, right? It's like from Marie's perspective,", "1701.36": "what I'm sensing here is that you've already moved past this whole like, oh, you men, women,", "1706.96": "doesn't matter, right? This is you being a great human, being a great, you know, fighter for your", "1712.48": "life and you live the life as you want to be. It doesn't matter, you know, what you have, right?", "1716.88": "It doesn't matter your gender. So I think that is very makeable, very interesting.", "1722.32": "But then, you know, from a guy's viewpoint, right? There'll always be this like, we don't understand", "1727.28": "how ladies do some stuff, right? It's like, you know, like how they always say like, ladies from Mars,", "1732.96": "ladies from Venus, right? And then guys from Mars, it's like, my God, we live in a different world, right?", "1737.84": "Like we think we know, but actually when we sit down, we talk, we don't really know.", "1742.32": "So then there's this one thing that, you know, I think there's a lot of stereotypes around.", "1747.2": "So because I'm not women, I don't try to act like I know. I'm trying to ask you, ask you ladies about, right?", "1752.24": "So it's like, there's a stereotype that, you know, women keep hidden cash, right?", "1756.24": "\u79c1\u623f\u94b1, right? Hide in the wardrobe, deep down, got this one box down there.", "1760.24": "If you can dig, dig, dig your mom's drawer, sure can find it. Although I never found it.", "1763.76": "Don't ask me why I dig there. But anyway, so I was just kind of curious, like,", "1768.24": "do you ladies actually have this kind of like, you know, you feel like the need to keep a special stash", "1774.4": "away so that, you know, your partner doesn't know that you have this kind of excess cash", "1778.8": "for whatever reason that it is. Now, let us take a break and we will be back with more questions", "1783.52": "for the ladies in the house. For all of you who have some interesting questions for them,", "1786.96": "reach out to us on our socials, on our telegram group, and yeah, we'll direct the questions", "1790.88": "over to the ladies at the Mistress' Class.", "1799.76": "Hey guys, I know you're expecting an ad, but yes, at this moment, I just want to thank you", "1804.16": "for supporting us and I hope that you can share this podcast with one other person today.", "1808.4": "At the same time, if you really enjoy what we are doing, head over to whichever platform you're", "1812.08": "consuming our podcast and drop us a review so that more people can get in touch with", "1816.48": "The Financial Coconut. Meanwhile, take care, stay healthy, and keep learning. See ya!", "1828.56": "Uh, actually when you talk about that, I'm looking, I think it was wardrobe.", "1832.24": "I think it's not hidden in a wardrobe. I think it's actually up front on display,", "1837.04": "where they spend the money on the clothes, the shoes, the bags, right? Maybe not so much these", "1842.88": "few months, right? But I think it's widely believed that women do tend to save more,", "1847.44": "and as you said earlier, tend to be more conservative, and somehow have this feeling", "1853.12": "like they need to, you know, maybe it's a maternal instinct as well. But, and research also shows", "1858.4": "that mothers' retirement pot is also lower than the man's, a man's, a father's, okay? And of", "1865.44": "course, this is largely due to women taking time off work, right? To be the main carer in the family,", "1870.48": "and kind of losing maybe 10 years of their productive, I wouldn't say productive, sorry. I", "1876.8": "would say, you know, earning capabilities. Because some of them, even when they try to get back to", "1882.0": "work, you know, it's hard to get opportunities, right? Because 10 years out of the market.", "1887.52": "So how do they do that? We were saying that they save more, right?", "1891.6": "They secretly save and don't talk about it, right? Is that the truth?", "1895.92": "Um, I don't...", "1897.28": "Because when you're coming from the whole idea of retirement planning, right? I thought that was a", "1900.8": "great point. And I'm not really like at the level of retirement planning. So when I think about it,", "1905.68": "so if I'm married, then retirement should be a together thing, ma. You know, but what you", "1909.44": "objectively brought out is that retirement is a separate thing, right? The man has a certain pot,", "1912.88": "the lady has a certain pot. Yeah. Right. So is that how retirement planning should be for women?", "1917.76": "Or is it as a family entity, should we plan it together? Or how does that, you know, secure the", "1923.68": "lady's financial interests in the long run? Yeah. Yeah. So if I'm talking about, typically,", "1929.68": "if both work, right? Okay. Then, I mean, the big part in Singapore is a CPF. So that's your", "1935.36": "retirement pot. Inevitable. Right. But if you stop working, of course, your retirement pot,", "1940.24": "you know, becomes smaller. Right. So, um, what I do is encourage a lot of the fathers or men to", "1947.44": "actually, you know, transfer some of the CPF balance to their spouse. Okay. Or even the other", "1952.32": "way around. Sometimes it's a man who is, you know, a stay at home. Um, because when it gets too", "1957.28": "lopsided, right, uh, it becomes a problem. Um, you know, you know that for CPF, you know, when", "1964.32": "you get to 65, you get a certain monthly annuity from CPF. Uh, and if you don't have that much in", "1970.56": "there, you don't get it. Right. So in a way it's balancing out and providing for the other half.", "1976.08": "So that at least it's more equitable. Right. Because women don't really get paid,", "1980.4": "you know, by working in the home in a way. Right. Yeah. So, uh, but definitely a couple should plan", "1987.6": "together, of course. But what I'm saying is that if they don't plan, this is what happens. Right.", "1992.48": "And the other thing about, uh, saving is sometimes I think women also feel that, um,", "1997.92": "they, they, you know, somehow with numbers or stock market, you know, it's just switch off.", "2004.72": "Like it's too complicated. Very stressed, you know, but they don't just, they can have economic", "2010.0": "degrees, you know, but it's like, oh no, no, I leave that to my husband. Oh, I hear that so much.", "2014.4": "And that's really something I feel, you know, uh, if, if let's say you start young as a millennial,", "2019.76": "you know, just have an interest in it. Um, and, uh, and, and I do a lot now in terms of that", "2023.76": "aspect, trying to have webinars and actually just open it out there, you know, have questions,", "2028.56": "you know, there's no silly question. In fact, um, and women also tend to do a lot more research,", "2033.04": "right? They tend before they make a decision. So maybe that's why they tend to be more, um,", "2038.32": "they tend to save more in that sense. Yeah. But saving is, has his own risk as well in terms of", "2042.96": "inflation, for example. So, so, so when you, when you, when you said, right, there was this one", "2048.96": "term as a live it to the husband. Yeah. Right. And what, what is the issue with that? Like,", "2053.76": "because it sounds like there is an issue with that. So I think that is an interesting viewpoint,", "2057.6": "right? It's like, why is living things to the husband, maybe not as applicable today,", "2063.28": "whereas it was actually applicable in the past because now actually women works, you know,", "2066.88": "it's not everything like, right? So women contribute to family, you know, income also.", "2073.44": "So then is there a need to also plan everything or can they still leave it to the husband? I think", "2079.36": "that's a, that's an interesting, I think, uh, can I take this question? So, uh, my mentor shared", "2084.8": "with us this story. Uh, his wife deliberately went to withdraw $10,000 cash and put it in a", "2091.28": "little box and in this little box, she put it inside the cupboard, right? No secret to the", "2096.16": "husband. Just, just, just put it in the cupboard. Yeah. I know her. I know her. Yeah. And then so", "2102.56": "the, the, the husband asked her, you know, why you do that for? I mean, we have a lot of money", "2106.88": "in there, millionaires and all of that, you know, why, why you do that? Why do you want to put aside", "2111.36": "this $10,000 cash? She said, it is not a matter of putting that cash. It's a matter of my peace", "2116.32": "of mind and the security that I feel that there's some money sitting there kind of thing. So, um,", "2123.12": "so I come back to my story, right? Is this, my mother saves like crazy. She virtually stinch on", "2129.76": "everything. You know, she will go and buy Recon aircon, right? And then it will last for six", "2134.32": "months, the aircon drop off. And then she will keep doing that. Buy fridge that's like all Recon,", "2138.88": "everything Recon because she's, she thinks she's saving money. But what she's wasting is all those", "2143.52": "electricity bill that goes up because of old, old, um, you know, old stuff and all that. Right.", "2148.88": "And she would, she would eat porridge with my poor dad, you know, and save money, you know, and save,", "2154.32": "save, save, save, save to the point where like, they're not looking after themselves. So towards", "2158.32": "the last part, before my mom passed away two years ago, two years plus ago, right, they were very", "2163.28": "skinny and scrawny. So it becomes like, you know, yes, I got, I got no mortgage to pay. You know,", "2170.0": "I got some money, I feel secure. But on the other hand, right, these things are all falling apart,", "2176.0": "you know? And so I think that the driving force is actually the security aspect of like knowing,", "2182.24": "you know, I have, I don't owe anybody. I don't, my children are not having to suffer", "2188.0": "because if we spend anyhow, then the, the, the children will suffer. The children will have to", "2192.96": "pay mortgage. Then the debt is passed down generation to generation. So when I came back", "2198.48": "from, from Hong Kong back to Singapore, right, I, I opened up their savings and I said, look,", "2203.68": "you know, enough of this nonsense because what happens is their health suffers. So we end up,", "2207.84": "instead of saving $300, you spend $6,000, you know? So, so it went into the reverse of all", "2215.28": "these things. Yes, she may have security of mine, but the health is affected. The family is affected", "2222.24": "in a sense. So, you know, yes, we as women want to save. We as women have this maternal instinct", "2228.48": "to not let our children suffer or not let the family, you know, financial situation to be in", "2236.64": "dire straits. But you got to understand, right, does your saving really help the situation or", "2242.4": "make it worse? Yes, you can have security, but how can you have security? Perhaps, like what", "2246.88": "Jeanette say, perhaps learn something about, you know, stocks and bonds and shares and all this.", "2252.32": "And I would encourage all the ladies out there to reach, to read this book by Kim Kiyosaki called", "2258.0": "Rich Woman. And she talks about women that, you know, pretty much dependent on the husband and", "2263.84": "then the husband run away or die, you know, then they virtually don't know what to do after that.", "2268.64": "So I encourage you to read that book. Yeah, I would like to add on my personal experience", "2275.6": "to the point you mentioned about leave it to the husband. So I have the real experience from", "2281.44": "my cousin. My cousin is actually quite well to do. It's like in Malaysia, he's got a few bungalow house", "2288.72": "and the wife actually is the housewife. So she doesn't have like, you know, keep a secret stash,", "2295.92": "because the husband would not allow her to do that. Okay, so she's like happily living with him.", "2302.8": "So one day, she found out that in a shopping mall, she caught that my cousin, okay, I hope my cousin", "2309.6": "is not listening to this. I'm sure he will be listening to this. My cousin actually was the one", "2315.92": "that telling her that, right, he doesn't like to go shopping. But on one fine day, she caught that", "2322.56": "my cousin actually hang out with another mistress. Yeah, sorry.", "2326.0": "Woman, woman, woman.", "2328.0": "Okay, use the right word.", "2330.0": "There are 12 definitions in the dictionary. Only one is the non-good one.", "2334.8": "Got it, got it.", "2335.44": "I remember I got this in class.", "2338.48": "Yeah, so coming to the story. So she found out and she like called my cousin in front of face to", "2346.24": "court him, you know, red handed. So when they get back home, right, my cousin actually told her that", "2351.68": "there you can divorce him or not, right, because she doesn't have money. Then you know, divorce me,", "2358.24": "you will lose. Because right, you I mean, like the court, the divorce court, things like that,", "2364.4": "I only a lot of money, you don't have money. It's all from me. Right. So she was very upset. She", "2370.0": "can't do anything. Yeah, so so one thing I want to know, so she doesn't. She shared my mom actually,", "2376.32": "she, she didn't trust that she can go back to the workforce. So because of she's already unskilled,", "2382.64": "not working in the society for very many years. So I would just this. So she just acquired laws,", "2389.12": "keep it quiet. And then my cousin just go around. But of course, I can't tell her to divorce my", "2394.0": "cousin, because my cousin is also my relative. So it's like in this kind of vicious cycle in the", "2400.24": "family dynamics, right, that cause an issue. So I would say that, I mean, from my age, right,", "2406.32": "that see all this saga that happened, I would just say that it's not about just keep that stash of", "2411.76": "money. It's also like what Marie said about security, not just about resources, and also", "2417.6": "emotionally, and also for her self-esteem as well as the power to step up, voice out, to walk away", "2425.36": "confidently from the relationship. Yeah, so I was quite sad to see her lost all those things from", "2432.72": "her. And, and also my, I think my cousin's son is called nephew, right, has to go through all this", "2439.76": "vicious cycle. So I was so right to recommend that ladies in my age, right, usually we don't", "2446.48": "think about like keeping the secret stash of money, especially millennials nowadays. We will", "2452.0": "spend more and save less. Yeah, because we think that, I still got a long way to go, you know,", "2457.2": "in this stage of life. And then maybe the future husband, we can get a rich man, you know, right,", "2461.76": "and then think later. So now just go travel, go ladies. Crazy rich Asians, right? Yeah, crazy rich Asians.", "2468.4": "And buy luxury stuff, go spend.", "2470.24": "Yeah, no stress.", "2472.24": "So this is, yeah, no stress, you know, they say because after marriage, no freedom. So now go and crazy rich Asians.", "2478.24": "But the worst is not crazy rich Asians, it's crazy Asian, not rich.", "2483.68": "Yeah, correct. I also want to take this chance, right, for the women that are listening to this", "2488.32": "as well. Yeah, I think I read a book about rich women as well. I'm blessed that I now have this", "2493.12": "opportunity to get myself financially trained as well, because this is not what the school has", "2499.52": "taught us. We have to really go and learn it and not rely on other people to pave our life.", "2507.12": "Correct, correct. I agree. Yeah, and if I can add on, I mean, this is exactly why I'm passionate", "2512.32": "about doing what I do. Because it starts with awareness. If we continue doing what we do,", "2518.64": "then, you know, you don't want to be in a stage where you have no choice, you know, and that is", "2523.44": "like at the mercy of, I mean, that's the worst thing that can happen in a marriage, right? And you,", "2528.72": "it becomes almost like a power play, right? And you're being bullied in that way. Yeah. So,", "2533.28": "we need to actually be defensive in a way. But also, it's very interesting, actually, I mean,", "2538.72": "I don't know to me. And I would, but I know it's very daunting. And it can be something that if you", "2544.24": "really don't like, you know, it's, you know, you can be very good at a lot of other things,", "2548.16": "but that can be an area that you really don't know where to start, for example. So, find a good friend", "2553.76": "or someone or join a group, join a club, you know, and, you know, find a good financial advisor,", "2560.56": "you know, a professional one, you know, and then go from there, you know, get someone to hold your", "2566.16": "hand and go together. You don't have to be alone in this, right? Yeah. And I think a lot of these", "2571.28": "things, right, they all stem from changing family and social dynamics, right? Because in the past,", "2576.32": "women didn't have a choice. So, this, this, this, all these discussions didn't exist because", "2580.96": "there was no choice, right? But now, because there is a choice and there's a push towards", "2585.6": "women empowerment and the independent women, then, although it solves one problem, but it", "2591.52": "opened a whole new set of problems. Like, how do you manage your finances? And how do you manage", "2595.12": "your finances and your husband's finances? And how do you manage the family structure and all", "2599.76": "these kind of different dynamics that, you know, we can go on and on and on and on about. So, I'm", "2605.28": "sure we cannot finish everything in one day. There'll be so much more. I definitely hope that", "2610.08": "you ladies will be interested to come back. Next episode.", "2614.48": "Yeah, yeah, definitely. We'll come back again next episode. But I think one thing that you ladies", "2621.12": "can share because you're a different phase of your life. And I'm curious, like, is there a change in", "2627.44": "like spending patterns when you go from a girl to a woman? Right? Do you see yourself spend differently?", "2635.68": "Right? Not like exactly what Yvelyne said, right? No, young, just play, have fun, a lot of", "2639.28": "money, it's okay, right? Just go and do your crazy rich Asian stuff. At what point do you decide that,", "2644.24": "okay, now I need to switch and actually look further? How does that affect your spending patterns?", "2651.2": "I think it's also to stem from family, how do you say, influence. Yeah. So, if you are born", "2660.32": "into a rich family, you may think that, you know, everything is honky-dory for you, kind of thing.", "2666.32": "So, I have coaches that are filthy rich, but the baggage that they have from being born in a rich", "2674.0": "family is actually unbelievable that we wouldn't think of. For example, I relate one case to you,", "2681.6": "which may not be related to financial, but it has everything to do with being born into a rich", "2686.56": "family. So, pictures like crazy rich Asian, unfortunately, is a story, okay? So, may not happen", "2694.16": "in real life, in that sense. So, what happened was, I was at a very rich person's house and then the", "2699.52": "mistress of the house, mistress of the house, okay? Okay, so, and then she was trying to pour a glass of", "2705.2": "water and she has always been in a rich family where she got servants and all that. So, when she", "2710.88": "tried to pour the glass, she broke the glass on the floor and what she did was she just stood there and", "2715.52": "stared at the broken pieces. She doesn't know what to do. She doesn't know to take a broom, to do all", "2721.76": "these things. It was her husband who was not from a rich family, who was the one that says, okay,", "2726.4": "don't step on the glass, step out of the glass area, you know, move aside. He was the one that", "2730.96": "took the broom and the dustpan, everything, and sweep it out. So, you know, doesn't give you that", "2737.04": "kind of life's training, in that sense. So, it comes down to emotions and all that. How do you deal", "2744.24": "with a lot of money? How do you deal with no money? You know, there are two different spectrum kind of", "2749.6": "thing. So, my culture, in that sense, I'm born in a middle-income family, but my mother has never,", "2757.28": "in a sense, like, spoil us. We have to learn to save money. We have to learn to, like, spend money.", "2764.48": "But when we buy something, she will always say, what you need it for? Do you need it because you", "2769.12": "want it or need it or whatever reason for it, kind of thing. And she will always, like, encourage us to,", "2775.36": "you know, not just save money, to just spend wisely, in a sense, more on needs than wants.", "2780.8": "Yeah. But then you have another generation, it's like, spend, spend, spend, spend. But then the", "2785.36": "thing is, at the end of the day, right, you open up your cupboard, then you get an avalanche of", "2789.52": "stuff coming down, right? And you're like, what do I do with them? Put on carousel.", "2794.4": "So, what I'm picking up here is that you're saying that spending habits is more generational", "2799.36": "rather than transformational. That means, like, you don't actually change your spending habits over", "2804.08": "time, but it is a lot more packed to the generation that you're in.", "2809.28": "Yes and no. If all things being equal, COVID didn't happen. Let's say, for example, right,", "2816.08": "you will continue to spend. But if you hit a crisis in life, financial crisis in life,", "2821.28": "you will definitely change your spending habits.", "2824.32": "Okay. Thanks for sharing.", "2825.6": "Yeah.", "2826.24": "Anything to add, Jeanette? You've traveled so many different places. I'm sure, you know, even the", "2831.76": "price differences across, no, you don't feel anything about it.", "2835.12": "Well, now I know that when I, I'm very afraid of clutter now.", "2841.76": "So, carousel is a good friend.", "2844.0": "I hope not to use carousel.", "2845.28": "Okay.", "2846.08": "But now, before I buy anything, I think quite hard. It's not just about whether I can afford it,", "2851.12": "how much it is. It's about, first of all, do I have it already? You know, I think when this culture,", "2858.96": "this consumerism that's so, okay, we can talk about like different countries, being in different", "2863.52": "countries, Singapore, my goodness, you go to any mall, you definitely spend money, you know,", "2870.24": "and becomes like a habit.", "2872.56": "Yes.", "2872.88": "Right. And I think, I guess, speaking to a lot of millennials on the call here, listening,", "2877.36": "is like very natural.", "2879.12": "Yeah.", "2880.72": "But I would say that, you know, think twice. Do you really need this?", "2884.64": "Yeah.", "2885.12": "And if you do, then is there another, you know, you, can you, you know, you know what I learned", "2890.4": "living overseas is one item can have many uses. You don't need to have in the kitchen, you don't", "2895.68": "need to have a knife for cutting avocado, a knife for cutting tomato. Okay. You can use one knife", "2902.88": "for everything. Okay. Well, that's quite extreme. I know. But definitely in terms of spending habits,", "2910.0": "that changes, you know, with life stages. And of course, when you get married, of course, when you,", "2916.32": "of course, when you become a parent, you know, that, that is the biggest thing. Yeah. I find,", "2921.2": "at first I was, you know, you go to supermarkets, the first area, or when you go to malls, you know,", "2925.76": "you always go to the kiddie stuff, right? Because that's all you think about. Yeah.", "2929.36": "Yeah. So essentially, there must be some life events that will then change your habits and", "2935.2": "change your perspective of how you value the dollar.", "2938.16": "Yes, yes. But unless something disrupts that. Yeah, like a crisis, right?", "2942.24": "A crisis, yes. But also I would say, which now the more I think about it is having a good mentor.", "2949.6": "When you are young, you know, always look for someone older than you, who you aspire to be like.", "2955.92": "Yeah. Yeah. And if that person, I used to think, I mean, I know someone who happened to have an", "2962.24": "uncle who was very keen on property. And that uncle and my friend is like quite blur, right?", "2968.64": "And this uncle actually told him, hey, you know, you should buy this, you know, and whatever. And", "2973.52": "so he said, okay, I have some spare cash, I can put it on, I buy it. And he's a millionaire now.", "2977.92": "So there's a, there's a point where, you know, if somebody were to come and give you some ideas,", "2985.76": "advice, you can take it at a point, you know, that can change your life, right? So it's not", "2990.0": "necessarily due to life stage, but also this kind of disruptions. Yeah. Okay. That's interesting.", "2995.12": "Yeah, maybe I also can add on as well. I think it's more also towards how much knowledge you", "3000.48": "have about financial things like that. Because what I observed among my age group and the age", "3006.08": "group that is older than me, is that our age group is that we will think, spend now, think later.", "3011.84": "No savings is kind of like a long, very painful thing. Yeah. So and especially because of the,", "3017.6": "I would say generation changes, okay, transformational changes in the market. Like", "3022.32": "right now we just tap on our phone, like Lazada, Shopee, we can easily buy something.", "3026.88": "And Shopee keep bombarding you, right? Everyday. Correct. Correct.", "3029.28": "Shop, shop, beep, beep, beep. Correct. Correct.", "3031.36": "Everyday I also know how to sing the jingle. Yeah.", "3032.8": "But I never use. And like what you say about carousel, it's like we don't need it,", "3036.8": "we just sell on a carousel, you know. So we will not think that lifespan is that long.", "3041.44": "We just think about now. It's the very instant gravitation kind of thing that a lot of young", "3046.56": "millennials we are having, because right now even cloak travel is so cheap. I mean, like pre-COVID.", "3050.96": "So we will go. Now even cheaper.", "3053.28": "Even you can see like the primary. If you can go.", "3055.6": "Yeah. If you can go.", "3056.4": "If you can go. Yeah.", "3057.2": "Or right now the primary school students are buying Starbucks. Oh my God. I mean, like,", "3062.4": "you can, I mean, like my age, I mean, like my era also, I was like, I can't even afford a Starbucks,", "3066.72": "you know. We will save that money to buy another bigger toy, you know. Yeah. So I would say it's", "3071.68": "also a bit of generational changes and also the peer pressure as well. And right now is that,", "3079.68": "okay, I'm not just spending, it's also for investment. There's also so many investment", "3084.48": "platform and like, for example, crypto, I will say stock shares that you can go in as low as", "3091.2": "thousand dollars, because right now, because of the FinTech development, right? I mean, like the", "3096.24": "younger generation, we tend to not go in so much of fact finding. We just, friends say good, good,", "3101.28": "this is good. And then we just go in. Yeah. So that's where a lot of young people like us got", "3106.16": "burned because we don't have much financial knowledge about how it works. We don't really", "3112.16": "go in depth to study how it works. And then we just want to get quick reach.", "3116.72": "You need to subscribe to the podcast.", "3119.04": "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think this is a lot of millennials what we're facing because", "3123.36": "nowadays I will hear a lot of friends say, I lend my friends money, then go investment.", "3127.68": "No, we definitely in the early twenties, we hit this kind of lessons. Actually, we shouldn't,", "3133.04": "we don't need, we can bypass all these lessons run by like what she say, find a right mentor.", "3137.28": "Yeah. Or even listen to a podcast.", "3139.36": "Thank you. Thanks for plugging.", "3143.6": "Actually, I want to elaborate on what you just said, right? You realize that this is not unique", "3148.0": "to the millennial generation. Actually, it's just the previous generation have all made their", "3151.76": "mistakes also. Right. Right. It's just that in, in maybe in our current generation, some of the", "3157.68": "things are different because of increased accessibility, right? Because all these kind", "3160.56": "of FinTech, you can now easily and readily do it. Right. So for all you millennials out there,", "3166.0": "don't bash yourself if you've made some mistakes and, you know, definitely talk to people that are", "3170.56": "wise and, you know, we will have a deeper discussion about what is wise as we go along.", "3174.64": "So no, no worries about that. And to sum up, you know, the session today, I know you ladies are", "3180.48": "way more than just about finance, right? So could each of you just kind of share with us,", "3185.76": "you know, some life lesson that you would love to share with all the young ladies tuning in today.", "3191.28": "So I just want to link this in with exactly what Ivinum was saying, you know, in terms of", "3196.56": "investments. I mean, of course, that's, that's, that's really what I am passionate about right", "3202.4": "now. But also Reggie, I've listened to your podcast and I know you like to go by three points.", "3208.24": "Yes. I've done homework. So I have three points. Okay. So the first one is diversification.", "3215.68": "So, you know, diversification in, in the investments, yes, in finances, but also in", "3222.48": "terms of friends. Okay. And, and maybe I say that from experience and that, you know, don't,", "3230.48": "I tell my kids now, you know, in the canteen at recess, don't just sit with the same people.", "3235.52": "Of course they don't understand, right. Cause they're like primary school, but I mean,", "3238.8": "just trying to open up, you know, there's so many different people, you know, so interesting.", "3243.52": "Everyone has different stories, you know, join different groups, you know, go to different", "3246.96": "social gatherings and all that. And, and widen that perspective. So diversification, you know.", "3253.04": "Point number two. Point number two is the power of compounding. Yeah. And, oh my goodness,", "3258.0": "you know, Albert Einstein said it's the eighth wonder of the world, you know, and, and very", "3262.4": "often, yes, when I do speak to millennials, it's like, oh, I just started working. I want to enjoy,", "3266.32": "which pub shall we go, you know? And whereas we, you know, we go to like, hey, we got free drinks", "3271.68": "tonight. Ladies night. I got a whole list of ladies night. We go pub hopping, you know. But,", "3278.4": "but that's precisely why you should get started because you have time on your side. You know,", "3283.04": "I did this calculation. If you set aside $1,000 a month in an investment vehicle that you 6.5% a", "3288.72": "year, in 20 years, you would have half a million. Yeah. And that's the power of compounding. And", "3294.56": "setting aside $1,000 a month, I don't know, maybe to, to some people, you know, it's quite a lot,", "3299.2": "you know, but that's just the idea. You can start with 200, 500, at least get started, you know, and,", "3305.12": "and at least that's a good habit to form. I mean, especially as young as possible,", "3308.88": "right? And also Google the rule of 72. I think that's one good thing. And the third thing,", "3313.6": "again, I come back to finding a mentor and not just on a, you know, financial side of things,", "3318.56": "but where you want to go, you know, in life, what you want to do, you know, where do you aspire to", "3323.68": "be in 5, 10 years time, you know, and it could be a family member, you know, an auntie, even,", "3329.52": "you know, a colleague, even your boss, it could be right. And what I'd say is, you know, invite", "3335.36": "them out for coffee, you know, say, buy them lunch, ask them questions, you know, listen to", "3339.92": "their advice, you know, be open minded. And that is so good if you can learn from someone who's", "3343.92": "done it before. Yeah, usually they will end up paying for the lunch anyway. Yeah.", "3347.52": "From my personal experience, that's the same case also.", "3349.52": "Their advice say, you know what, you listen to me.", "3351.52": "Yeah, but you know, I don't know, maybe it's age or what, I feel like I really have so much", "3356.08": "to share, you know, that's why Evelyn Deer, you know, we are going to have coffee soon, yeah?", "3360.08": "But, you know, I feel like I want to share so much, you know, and so when you're a millennial,", "3364.48": "you know, grasp this opportunity when people love to teach you, you know, and then you don't have", "3369.76": "to go through it yourself, right? Thank you. Thanks for sharing.", "3373.28": "I also have three points. Okay.", "3374.88": "That's cool. Okay, okay.", "3376.56": "Point number one is need versus want. So what you do is like when you see something that you want", "3381.28": "to buy, right, just hold first, think about it for 24 hours. If it's still desirable for you after 24", "3388.96": "hours, then you probably need it in a sense. So I have like $100 in my pocket, I can go in a", "3395.04": "shopping center and still come out with $100. Now, that's a power of self-control. And also think", "3401.6": "like if it's a need, right, what do you need it for? Are you going to use it like more than five", "3406.16": "times? If not, then don't bother, basically. So number two is set up boxes. So pay yourself first.", "3413.36": "So when your salary comes in, right, put 10% aside for yourself. And then if your husband and wife do", "3419.04": "the same thing. Now, I have my own account, my husband has his own account, and we have a joint", "3424.88": "account. So all the salaries will come into the joint account. Then we give ourselves, you know,", "3429.52": "two boxes each. One for our own savings and one for us to spend. And then the rest is to pay bills", "3437.92": "and everything. So that's another thing. The third thing is join our mistress class.", "3445.2": "Why I say join a mistress class? So if you need explanation, you know, ask to join into the FP", "3451.44": "private page, you have all the explanation there. But why I say join is because we have people like", "3455.36": "Jeanette and Evelyn there, you know, with all the things in a sense like coming back to the mentors.", "3460.56": "You don't need just one mentor, you can have a few mentors in a sense with different facets of your", "3465.36": "life or seasons of your life too. So mistress class has got people that can give you some advice,", "3470.64": "help you through the emotional roller coaster also. Because it's not just a method of saving", "3475.04": "money. What about losing money? What about when you lost your job? What about, you know, you don't", "3480.08": "know when the next meal is coming or these things. You need all the support. And we are here to form", "3484.8": "a net to catch you before you fall, basically. So it's mistress class. Okay. It's SG underscore", "3491.12": "mistress class. Yeah, it's nothing to do with that extra woman. So just thought I'd let you know.", "3496.72": "That's cool. Yes, Evelyn. Okay, so three points as well. More towards young women.", "3504.56": "Love yourself first. It's okay to be alone. A lot of women, it's like they are coming 30s,", "3510.96": "they'll start panicking that, oh my god, am I going to be spinster? So they start to go to", "3516.72": "Tinder, a lot of dates. No, you don't need that. You see, if we invest in ourselves,", "3522.72": "be emotionally rich, be confident in what we're doing, add values to people, we'll live a", "3528.16": "fulfilling life and attract the right people into our life. Right? So there's no scarcity in this", "3534.0": "life of abundance. Secondly, be like water. And I think that it's a privilege to be a woman in this", "3539.76": "era. You can show your feminism as soft approach when you saw some man being angry,", "3546.64": "and he's like, just a bit, you know, soft approach. And then right after that, when the person", "3553.04": "like calm down, you can show your masculinity to be tough, show your tough side. So it can be like", "3558.56": "water. We just need to know how to use that at the right setting. Thirdly, self-sufficiency.", "3565.04": "Yeah. So I think just now you mentioned, it's not just financially, it's also emotionally. And", "3569.2": "most importantly, it's our intelligence as well, financial intelligence. So", "3574.08": "and to hear our inner voice, when there's something that we want to voice up, step up and", "3579.12": "voice up. Yeah. And lastly, willpower will not last. I think you guys are my mistress club and", "3586.24": "Financial Coconut has a very good environment. You know, relate ourselves in the right environment,", "3591.12": "right? That's where we can grow together. Right? So that's all I'm sharing. Thank you.", "3595.12": "Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. I don't think I really need to plug myself anymore.", "3598.56": "The ladies have done a great job and sharing with all of you today and definitely check out", "3602.96": "Mistress Class on Facebook and for any more future episode, definitely continue to join us", "3608.32": "at the Financial Coconut.

Those that are already in the university", "83.0": "and the other group is the people that are considering going to the university.", "87.0": "Because I think the general pitch out there is like anti-uni at this point in time.", "94.0": "Of course, the uni people will never say it's shit.", "97.0": "But I think among all your quote-unquote gurus, a lot of fucking internet gurus,", "102.0": "they're all like, you know, the general narrative is that you don't need to go to university to succeed.", "107.0": "Which I don't think is wrong, right?", "109.0": "But I got you today to pitch to the people that are considering university,", "115.0": "why should they go to the university?", "117.0": "Because I feel that you have essentially kind of really milked the system.", "125.0": "I think on my part, I would say that there are a few things that I consider if I want to go to university.", "131.0": "I think the first would definitely be the fact that in the university itself,", "135.0": "you have groups of people around you and that itself is networks, you know, people", "140.0": "and having a source of ideas.", "144.0": "And that is akin to like in the past, Socrates, Aristotle,", "148.0": "having this area where people come together to share.", "151.0": "And I think that's very important because whether you like it or not,", "154.0": "we are all social people, we are all social creatures.", "157.0": "And we learn by being with each other, by doing things together.", "160.0": "And that's what to me the university really is about.", "163.0": "And I think perhaps the second thing that I'm thinking about for people who actually want to go to university", "169.0": "is that there are so many things that you could possibly learn on the internet yourself.", "175.0": "But then when a person does it together with you, it's a whole new different thing.", "181.0": "And of course, you know, you can actually just go to Coursera or edX and do a course", "185.0": "and do it with someone else that's matched online by like personality traits or like,", "189.0": "you know, God knows what these other things do, right?", "192.0": "But then it's going to be pretty much quite good.", "195.0": "But then it's still not as good compared to that human interaction", "200.0": "and having this person to understand that, hey, you know, this is a journey that I'm doing this with you.", "206.0": "And therefore, there are certain synergies, certain benefits that we can actually do it together.", "210.0": "So I think it's the second thing which I'm thinking about.", "212.0": "And probably the last thing which I'm really thinking about as well is that", "215.0": "this entire thing about university really is about brand.", "220.0": "And brand, unfortunately, right now, we have Coursera, edX, we have like so many other internet gurus,", "226.0": "as you mentioned, coming up, but these do not lend a brand.", "229.0": "So like, it's as if I were to say that right now, I listen to this guy, I applied his skill sets,", "237.0": "and then I achieve this. But then to me, to everyone around you is like, is it really true?", "242.0": "Are you really what you say you are? Or are you just like someone,", "245.0": "how can you say that you are actually as good as that person or have all these kind of traits or these skill sets", "253.0": "just by listening to, let's say, a 20-hour webinar, right?", "257.0": "Or something that's online, you know, it's very different versus, let's say,", "261.0": "an institution that has been there for a pretty long time, it's tried and tested,", "267.0": "it has been through ages, and it has been through even revolutions.", "272.0": "And I think that that's something which the brand of the university actually lends itself.", "276.0": "But then, that is where I think things will get out-bended, right?", "281.0": "Okay, so, essentially, based on what you just said, whether it's a brand, whether it's like a social circle", "288.0": "that is in school, you know, or whether it's like the kind of quality of education", "293.0": "that one can get interacting with a real individual rather than just like online webinar,", "299.0": "which I think a lot of people can understand.", "301.0": "They can comprehend this reality that it's really different learning face-to-face with a geek.", "307.0": "Essentially, your professors are geek, okay?", "309.0": "They spend tons and tons of their life to go and geek it out on some topic, right?", "313.0": "And sometimes they're not very passionate because they're not teaching the topic", "316.0": "that they're really passionate about.", "317.0": "If you're going to read their research paper, they're passionate about something else.", "321.0": "It's just not part of the repertoire and then I need to feed myself so I anyhow teach something.", "327.0": "I don't blame them, but if you want to learn more from your prof,", "331.0": "maybe you should also go and read a little bit about what they really love.", "335.0": "But all those things are very, how should I put it, very high order, right?", "340.0": "It sounds like, okay, we got a brand, we got network, we got better learning.", "346.0": "How does that translate to benefits in life?", "350.0": "In life, right?", "351.0": "Like, okay, I'm going to uni, so why should I go?", "355.0": "What are the real benefits that I'm going to get?", "357.0": "Other than all these kind of, like I get what you're saying, but yeah, how does that translate?", "361.0": "I think that like, we really go back to the social aspect", "365.0": "because the social aspect would then dictate that I am part of this group", "370.0": "and that is what the social aspect really does.", "373.0": "So, of course, we can actually create organizations that are similar to university", "377.0": "that actually creates this social kind of context and so on.", "381.0": "It's just that most of these things, us, are like tertiary, meaning that they come after university.", "388.0": "So I can think about, let's say, in the venture capital world, that's like Kauffman Fellows, right?", "392.0": "So Kauffman Fellows, essentially, if you are who's who in VC", "395.0": "and you want to do your stuff well and network,", "398.0": "you need to pay $200,000, attend this program,", "401.0": "and then go to US for like perhaps I think two to three months.", "404.0": "Yeah, and it's more expensive than an MBA.", "406.0": "But then people say that this program itself brings you more networks", "410.0": "than if you were to go to, let's say, Harvard or to go to Stanford.", "413.0": "And that's kind of a tertiary kind of thing to it", "416.0": "because they have really created a social thing.", "418.0": "But then that Kauffman Fellows, as an example, is something that's after a university", "425.0": "where people predicate and say that, you know, I have really done this,", "429.0": "I've really gone to this place where I am and I just need to get more networks", "433.0": "and that's where I get more networks from.", "435.0": "But then if you look at the profiles of the people who actually went for these things,", "439.0": "they tend to be having very good degrees.", "442.0": "Or even if they don't have good degrees, they come from good pedigrees.", "446.0": "Or even if they don't come from good pedigrees and they actually do drop out from school,", "450.0": "there was someone who took a chance on them.", "452.0": "And that percentage is extremely, extremely slim.", "455.0": "Extremely slim.", "456.0": "So I think that...", "457.0": "Rare people, right?", "458.0": "So I think that that really is what the reality sometimes is.", "462.0": "So based on success rate, the chances of you doing well in life", "466.0": "will probably be higher if you stuck to university.", "469.0": "In other words, that's what I'm trying to say.", "471.0": "In other words, this is what the statistics actually show.", "473.0": "Yeah, statistics show, right?", "474.0": "It's not learned from some internet guru and then suddenly,", "476.0": "wah, ni kei, you know, suddenly amazing, right?", "479.0": "Or, you know, the success rate of startups are like super, super low, right?", "483.0": "I think statistically it's about 5%, you know, or 5% that kicks off, right?", "489.0": "Those that really end up there, maybe it's like 0.5% or like 1%, you know,", "494.0": "of everyone that start.", "495.0": "That doesn't mean you shouldn't start, you know,", "497.0": "if you're passionate about something and you feel that there's a market gap,", "500.0": "do what you need to do.", "502.0": "But for the many out there, I think going to university is still quite a natural success", "508.0": "kind of journey if you want to do well, you know, and get to where you are.", "512.0": "And you are in, you know, essentially the private equity space, right?", "516.0": "Although you work for a family office, right?", "518.0": "But your focus is to get deals and it's very much a PE job.", "521.0": "Yeah, it's very much a PE job.", "522.0": "Just in a family office, right?", "524.0": "So, how did you get there, right?", "527.0": "Going to the university, right?", "528.0": "Share with us a little bit of your story.", "530.0": "Okay, okay.", "531.0": "I think like, I don't come from a traditional private equity background,", "535.0": "meaning that I didn't go to investment banking", "537.0": "and I didn't jump from investment banking to private equity.", "540.0": "And it's sort of weird, you're right, you know, like I'm in a multifamily office,", "544.0": "slightly different from private equity because one main difference,", "547.0": "for you guys here who don't really understand the industry,", "551.0": "it's just very simple, that we, instead of putting our money in the private equity funds,", "556.0": "we actually go direct.", "557.0": "Yeah, so that's really what we do.", "559.0": "And I think that that really necessitates a few other things", "562.0": "because you are not just deploying funds, but you're also sourcing.", "566.0": "And you're not just sourcing, but you're maintaining a relationship.", "568.0": "And that's where it's a sort of a bridge between private equity", "572.0": "and your private wealth because you cannot lose your money.", "574.0": "So the returns that I have, and I look at my deals,", "577.0": "are a lot more specific and of a higher bar.", "580.0": "So I think that's one key difference.", "583.0": "How I actually got here, I would say, is through a myriad of experiences.", "587.0": "So like some people ask me on my LinkedIn, like, you know, when I was younger,", "591.0": "they were like, why are you like doing all these other things in your life?", "595.0": "You know, you're doing management consulting and then suddenly going to tech", "598.0": "and then suddenly you go into shipping and then you do something else.", "601.0": "And then everyone's like, I mean, there is no clear trajectory.", "605.0": "So every time in an interview, I need to explain myself that, hey,", "609.0": "you know, it's not that I don't have a clear trajectory.", "611.0": "It's just that I wanted to do something which was different", "614.0": "and to build experiences and other things such that if I look at a business today,", "618.0": "I can assess it really fast.", "619.0": "So I think that that was what I really want to build.", "622.0": "But then, you know, myopically, if you're in e-commerce", "625.0": "and the e-commerce guy sees that you're in shipping, he'll be like,", "628.0": "dude, man, then what are you interviewing me here for?", "630.0": "You know, he doesn't understand it.", "631.0": "Yeah. So I think that was firstly the myriad of experiences.", "635.0": "Second, it was sort of this combination of various quote unquote hard skills.", "644.0": "And I'll call them quote unquote hard skills because this would relate to the degree.", "649.0": "So when I entered SMU, I was doing a double degree.", "653.0": "So I was doing law and economics.", "655.0": "And law itself is an extremely technical subject", "659.0": "because you need to understand the statutes.", "661.0": "You need to understand how to apply the law.", "663.0": "In other words, it's very boring.", "665.0": "Yeah. In other words, it's pretty boring.", "666.0": "Very dry. You've got to suck it up.", "668.0": "This is the constitution, right?", "670.0": "This is what we live by.", "671.0": "Yes. And I think that what really is quite interesting about that", "675.0": "is that you really understand how to debate your points.", "678.0": "And I think that's very important as you actually progress in the private equity world.", "683.0": "Because in private equity, when you source your deals,", "685.0": "essentially what you're doing is that you're being a lawyer.", "687.0": "You need to bring your case before, let's say, a quote unquote judge,", "690.0": "which is, let's say, your investment committee,", "692.0": "or bring a case to, let's say, your client, right?", "694.0": "And tell them that, hey, I have deal X and X.", "696.0": "These are my returns.", "698.0": "And these are the risk.", "699.0": "And why does my return and the risk make sense?", "702.0": "And you're doing a case for that.", "703.0": "And I think that's where the lawyering skills I had really come into play.", "706.0": "So I would suggest that sometimes you may, maybe an application point, right?", "712.0": "You may be in a degree that sort of doesn't have a certain route towards,", "718.0": "let's say, what you're doing.", "719.0": "But that's fine.", "720.0": "But then like, yeah.", "721.0": "Like history, literature.", "723.0": "Yeah, like history. Yes, correct.", "724.0": "Honestly, I have great friends that they studied history.", "729.0": "And when they were studying history, people would be like,", "732.0": "why you study history? You can't do what? Be teacher.", "735.0": "But then they got poached by the ministry to do foreign affairs.", "741.0": "Because they understand history and they understand different countries.", "745.0": "A lot of policies, where do they come from?", "748.0": "It's all stem from their history.", "750.0": "So I was like, oh, that's interesting.", "752.0": "I never thought it could get that way, right?", "754.0": "Yeah.", "755.0": "So I would say these two points.", "757.0": "Of course, there are definitely many others.", "758.0": "But then it would just mainly be the fact that I actually did many different things.", "763.0": "And I studied something which didn't have a bearing on finance.", "769.0": "So sometimes I always joke with my friends.", "771.0": "I told them that I studied law and economics,", "774.0": "but I get hired for finance and marketing skills.", "776.0": "So I think that brings to the point of the university thing, right?", "783.0": "Like, does it really need to have university?", "786.0": "Exactly.", "787.0": "And I think that's the question that I think we, Reginald and I, really want to answer today.", "791.0": "And I think it's not that simple.", "794.0": "It's a complex topic.", "796.0": "It's not that simple to just dissect it and say that, hey, you know, since you are just learning history in school,", "803.0": "why learn history?", "804.0": "At the end of the day, you're not going to be a historian.", "806.0": "You're just going to come out and be like someone who actually works in MFA.", "809.0": "Or worse still, you might be doing something that does not have any bearing on history,", "814.0": "like you're doing public relations or something like that.", "816.0": "But then how does it help?", "818.0": "So I think this is where going back to the points I made earlier on the social aspects,", "823.0": "and as well as having the brand name.", "825.0": "But I want to add a third point to this, which is that I think in a university, it's where you can actually discover yourself.", "833.0": "And unfortunately or fortunately, this really depends on the university you go to, right?", "840.0": "So there are some universities out there, we call them liberal colleges in the U.S., where it really allows you to expand.", "845.0": "And there is no judgment upon, you know, let's say I am an anthropology major.", "850.0": "And then tomorrow I tell myself that I want to study a computer science course.", "854.0": "You know, that's totally possible, right?", "856.0": "But then let's say you come from NUS, and then you actually, you know, you study like geography.", "861.0": "And then suddenly one day you just tell the people around you, hey, I just want to study computer science.", "866.0": "They're like, dude, this guy is nuts, you know?", "868.0": "Like this guy clearly is out of his mind.", "870.0": "And you suddenly find that you have no friends.", "872.0": "Yeah, people are like, what is wrong with this dude?", "875.0": "He's a weird guy, man.", "876.0": "Yeah.", "877.0": "So I think it really depends on which school you go to.", "879.0": "And, you know, coming from SMU, you know, I still have a bit of kouyou.", "883.0": "SMU does come in the middle ground.", "885.0": "SMU is a kouyou seller.", "887.0": "You have like people who actually sort of can actually do like economics.", "893.0": "And they can actually do law as well, like myself, you know, can actually like do a double major in other things which are not related.", "900.0": "But although then, of course, I need to give a disclaimer and a caveat there that not everyone does it right in SMU.", "908.0": "How many people actually do it?", "909.0": "Most of the people are finance plus accounting.", "911.0": "You know, it's not finance plus sociology or something like that.", "915.0": "So it's so different.", "917.0": "And I just want to chime in on the liberal colleges.", "920.0": "Right.", "921.0": "So for all of you, you know, have not gone to college, considering college, I'm not saying that Singapore has any liberal colleges.", "926.0": "I think we have one, the Yale partnership with NUS, right?", "931.0": "So you realize that in a lot of these liberal colleges, they allow you to enter university without having any fixed direction.", "941.0": "Right. So you're just joining year one.", "943.0": "Oh, what are you doing? No, I'm just year one here in Yale or something.", "946.0": "One of these liberal colleges.", "948.0": "And, you know, they do a cross field study so that, you know, you learn different, different stuff and you finally make a decision.", "954.0": "And along the way, if you want to pivot, you can always pivot.", "956.0": "I think that's the beauty of university as a discovery platform.", "960.0": "And I mean, even for yourself, right, you've done all these different things, whether is it studying your own clubs or, you know, going out there and trying different fields.", "971.0": "But all those things, do you think you could have done it without the university?", "978.0": "Right.", "979.0": "Right. Because it's a good question.", "980.0": "That is a question. Yeah.", "982.0": "It's a good question. It's a really great question, because I think that a lot of things which I have done, I would say it goes back to the social contracting.", "991.0": "Like, why would, why would you like, you know, when you start a community, like whether it is the mentoring circle, which I started or Atoms Watch Club or like Kogito Collective, right?", "1001.0": "All of them start because you are in a position of authority and you can actually say that I bring together a group of experts who know this thing well.", "1011.0": "And I bring that knowledge or like the education to other people and democratize it.", "1017.0": "So that necessitates you to have that authority in the first place.", "1021.0": "And where do you borrow that authority from? You borrow it from someone else, you know, like, which is like a school or university.", "1027.0": "And I think that's where being in a university definitely helps a lot because you are also borrowing the name of the university and coming from an Asian culture.", "1037.0": "And we are Asians ourselves. You know, you cannot go against the culture of the land. It's tough.", "1041.0": "Right. So like, like, for example, you know, people ask me about the minimum wage thing with James Lim and things like that.", "1046.0": "It's a contentious topic. Right. But then like, it's like bringing Scandinavian things, ideas in.", "1050.0": "Like, it might not work. You know, it may work. It might not work. So the cultural things might actually be different.", "1055.0": "So I think that like, if you were to go to the flip side, whether I were not to be in university and could actually start this, I think that definitely I can.", "1062.0": "But would it be as successful? I'm really not sure. But if I had no choice, you know, if I had no choice, I didn't go to university and I start this, definitely what I have done is that I'll be the maverick.", "1073.0": "And then I'll bring in people who are in these universities who have that brand name, that kind of like reputation and borrow that.", "1080.0": "So to me, it is, it is no longer about you, yourself, rather not about the organisation you're starting. But then what is your competitive advantage?", "1091.0": "If you find that your competitive advantage lies in the fact that you are better at pulling people in and you don't need your reputation, right?", "1097.0": "You just bring other people's reputation in and start this thing. Then it works. But if your competitive advantage is that, oh, maybe you're better at studying, you did well in school and that works for your advantage, then fine.", "1109.0": "You know, like you should work towards your advantage in most of the times.", "1112.0": "So in other words, what we can agree upon is if you really want to do something, you can get it done with or without the university.", "1120.0": "Yes, I agree.", "1121.0": "But there is some form of like brand leverage, that kind of authority leverage that you get in the university, being part of the university, which I agree because I'm a dropout, right?", "1133.0": "So from my optics, yeah, you can do man, everything else you can do. You can do it on your own. We live in a relatively free society, right?", "1140.0": "Some barriers you don't touch. But other than that, you can just go out and champion a lot of these things, right?", "1146.0": "And start whatever venture, whatever community you want to start. But it is an uphill battle, right?", "1151.0": "Because people see you as a solokian, right? People see you as like this guy's weird guy. And then, you know, you try to do something and then it's like, so what?", "1160.0": "But being in a university, you have the brand, you have the kind of like thought authority in the space, you borrow that brand.", "1168.0": "And also, I think there are just a lot of uni kids around waiting to be shepherded, honestly.", "1173.0": "Yes, yes.", "1174.0": "It's like, oh my God, you got a free market here. Everyone is here. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Dunce Dunce, SMU.", "1180.0": "I totally agree with you. I think that like, you're very right on that. The good thing about university is that there's a lot of talent.", "1187.0": "And like, I think we're talking about this. I don't know if I talked about this with you, but then this idea is that, you know, when you run a startup, it's very hard to find good talent.", "1195.0": "Because good talent usually wants to do their own startup.", "1197.0": "Yes.", "1198.0": "Yeah, but then SMU or NUS produces very good talent. They don't want to run their own startup, but work for you.", "1203.0": "Yeah, so that's the best, you know, I mean, if you're a business owner, like this is kind of one of the best things ever, right?", "1209.0": "Yeah, I totally get that. So I think we can, I think we have sufficiently shared, you know, the viewpoint where, you know, if you're considering university, we both recognize that a lot of things, you don't need the university to do it, even in today's context.", "1227.0": "I think, okay, maybe not even like, especially in today's context, when information is so liberal, you can learn on so many platforms, right? So that it is not a must that you need to go to the university.", "1239.0": "But by going to the university, you have all this leverage of social network, brand, authority in the space. And it's just much easier to kick off a lot of these small little stuff, right?", "1249.0": "Because that is my viewpoint. I have a lot of friends in the startup field, and a lot of them that are doing better started in the university.", "1256.0": "Yeah, right. Because in the university, you have all this kind of seller ecosystem and talent is everywhere. All these people are pretty smart. I mean, muggle or not, right? Even if they're a muggle, they're quite determined, right?", "1266.0": "That's why they managed to get to university. So you gotta give salute to the muggle, okay? I always say the muggle, muggle. But yeah, so you know, like, they got to university, there's a select, you know, process and you have all these people, then you, you, you work with them, you use them based on their talent.", "1281.0": "And then, you know, just kind of build your stuff, right? Or build your community in that process. So I think, you know, that is the value in the university at this point in time. And for people that are already in the university, right? What are your thoughts, you know, for them, right?", "1297.0": "Okay, since you're already inside already, right? Then you're listening to this podcast, right? Then what are you gonna, how are you gonna make your university better, right? How are you gonna like benefit through this thing rather than just going for lectures, missing tutorials, and then like, go and dance dance, you know?", "1311.0": "For all of you who have not been to SMU, there's this like underpass, right? That runs through the whole-", "1317.0": "Actually not everyone there is SMU though.", "1318.0": "Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It runs through the whole spine of the university, right? The underground basement spine. And then I was like, what tons of people are dancing. I was like, what's an SMU student? Don't they study? Just everyday kind of dance, hip hop, street, street, like that, right?", "1332.0": "But that aside, okay. Okay, but yes. So if they're in the university, right? How do they better, you know, you know, like benefit themselves in this process? How can they leech?", "1344.0": "Yeah, I think, yeah. I mean, leech also is a- Yeah, but I mean, the money they pay for university is not leech anymore. I think they're like, I think the university is leeching on them.", "1354.0": "Yeah, I mean, like, to answer your question, I'll just think a few things. One is definitely the fact that universities are really expensive. Like, I mean, in Singapore, we have it relatively cheaper, right?", "1364.0": "SMU is probably the most expensive. Law is the most expensive. SMU is around $6,000 for one semester. So it's 12k a year. Of course, don't discount, like, don't account for medicine. Medicine is different, right?", "1375.0": "But then that is the highest, you know, like, NUS is probably a bit cheaper. But then 12k a year is still pretty much, it is not very, very high. It's not like US or like UK or Australia, but it's still pretty high.", "1386.0": "And you're paying quite a huge sum to be in a university. And I think, as you rightly pointed out, you know, how do you actually leverage on this entire system? On that, I don't think that there are really any fixed routes.", "1398.0": "So what I mean is that, like, you know, going back to your dance point, you know, when you say that they dance, dance, right? Actually, when you dance, dance, it also helps you a lot.", "1404.0": "Like, like there's this club called E-Mix in SMU. And I think that like, within the community there, they actually share internships. They're pretty smart people, you know, they don't study the hardest, they don't get like the, I mean, some of them do get like very good grades, but not everyone gets the best grades.", "1419.0": "But then they're social, right? They are able to like get things done. They're able to, you know, wine and dine and like be a person and friend to other people that people like. And that's why they're hired. Yeah, so I think that that's that does play into aspect of life. And you know, sometimes dancing is not a bad thing.", "1436.0": "I can't dance. Okay. I can't dance. That's why I look at it. I was like, wow, quite cool. I just want to put it out there. Don't flame me. Okay. I'm not against dancers. I'm sure we have, I'm sure we have some dancers in the group, you know, you know, pursue your passion. I agree that I believe in that. Right. So it's just, I just use dance as a joke.", "1464.0": "I mean, you can also make a joke about people in the library all the time. Like me, I'm always in the library. So I was always in a pool. So, you know, like my friends are like, Hey, you come to country club or you come to uni. That's why one cent later I stopped coming. I thought to myself, yeah, I must make use of it. It's very expensive pool. You know, I pay $6,000. I better use this well.", "1485.0": "But yes. So, okay. I get the part about like, um, having a social network, being in school, you know, don't just be a mugger. Right. In other words, right. You want to do well in your exams. Okay. So be it. That's cool. Right. But you are in this like very fertile space where a lot of these people are either really hardworking, very smart, very rich.", "1506.0": "Yeah, it's true.", "1508.0": "So there is a social strata to it. Of course we can always talk about social mobility, how to like get more people in to this system and that's a good topic. We need to talk about it another time. Right. But assuming you are already in university, in other words, don't just mug. Don't just mug and, you know, join all these kinds of social groups. Right.", "1527.0": "True. Pursuing your passion. You never know what kind of professional opportunities can come in. Yes. Right. But, but beyond that, right. Is there, are there certain kinds of resources in school that, you know, you think they should leverage on, you know, like there's not so readily available out of school.", "1544.0": "Yeah. Maybe like incubator program or something. Yeah. I'll see if the best one is alumni. Alumni is definitely the best. Yeah. Yeah. Really? Because it's always about, it goes back to the social aspect. Why would someone help you? Because I come from the same school, you know, that's, that's a huge thing. Right. And like, whether you like it or not, you know, we have parliament fitted ACSI and RI boys.", "1565.0": "Yeah. You know what you want to call it? Where does Josephine Teo and Grace Fu come from? Like Archie girl maybe? I don't know. Check it out. I know what you mean. Yes. Yeah. But it's, it's not just Singapore, right? You have it in London. You're a bit like, uh, even in Mozambique and Africa as well. I mean, these, these, these countries also have these things. It's not, so don't flame. I don't think you should flame government. I think it's like, it's something which is inherent in social, social mobility and it's society's just like that.", "1591.0": "Yeah. And I think that that, that also really points to the fact that, um, yeah, having the alumni network that you have is pretty important. And that's something you can leverage on because we're lucky or not, you're going to remain a school forever. So, you know, when I, when I stepped up as the president of smooth, which is the entrepreneurship club in SMU, like some people ask me why I want to do it. And then I was like, yeah, you know, apart from the fact that I do get certain benefits, I talk to certain people and things like that, the normal yada yada.", "1619.0": "But then it's about the fact that like maybe apart from you and a few other people, like, well, who else is going to help the school? You know, who else has the networks? Who else has like the capabilities to actually bring things together? And you realize that as an alumni of the school, if you don't help the school, no one else is going to do it. The staff of the school won't do it because the stuff in the school come from maybe NUS. Yeah. You know what? Yeah. Yeah.", "1639.0": "Like a lot of stuff in SMU does come from NUS. And I mean, like they are after all. SMU did poach a whole bunch of NUS guys. And they are passionate about SMU, don't get me wrong. But the thing is that they are not alumni. And like, you need alumni to really say that, you know, helping the students actually helps me because I then have a better pool of students to actually pull from and they are in a way my mentees in a way. So I think that that's, that's one. And the other flip side, if you are like a student in school currently, you should really be like,", "1669.0": "you should be like, you should reach out to alumni because they are thinking that way. So that like the first point you're talking about, but then the other second point is mainly that you have shared experiences with them. You know, the dancing thing, you know, like it works. Like there's this alumni club, which is, so it's Emix, right? And then there's, I think Illuminix, which is the alumni club. And then they do actually talk to each other. And I think that there's so much synergies there. And more than that, it's just the fact that by reaching out to any alumni, they probably understand what you're going through. They know the teachers you went through.", "1699.0": "They know the classes, the classes may be slightly different, but then, you know, they'll talk about the same few things. I know this, this professor is like that, or like, you know, this class is such a useless class, like name drop, I don't know, business government society. So like, I don't know, things like that. It's just like not, not very useful in a way, but then people will just talk about these things, right?", "1719.0": "It is a lot of social comfort to have shared experience, right? I think this is inevitable, which is why, you know, when guys gather together, everybody talks about the army, right? Then all the girls will like turn off, right? It just doesn't work because they don't have the shared experience, you know, in this process. So I totally get what you're trying to say, you know, and I'm curious, like, was it difficult to get the president of the alumni entrepreneur club? You know, because what you just said was like, nobody wants to do it, right? It feels like nobody wants to do it.", "1747.0": "So in that sense, is it because nobody wants to do it? That's why you got it? Or is it because, you know, you're actually, you know, the best candidate?", "1756.0": "I think to look at it this way is that, you know, CCA is when you're young, right? Then like, you know, everyone just go to student council, things like that. But then you grow older, you realize you don't want to do it. Because there's no incentive. It's like CIP, right? You know, there's no incentive to do it. It's not cool anymore. And yeah, it's just different. Yeah, it's like, it's like, you know, it's not cool to do this anymore. I don't get any prestige. But then it seems like it's more work. Why should I do it? You know, like, I don't have to fulfill any criteria. It doesn't minus two points for my O levels, right?", "1783.0": "Yeah, so I think that there was a view at that point, that I think there's no incentive for many other people. Then second is that I'll say that because alumni clubs are tough to run, it's not paid, right? You're not getting paid for it. And other people are actually wanting you to continue and you need to be successful and you need to actually like do a good job of it because it still represents a school and represents the alumni who actually come from the school.", "1810.0": "So I think that previous predecessors would try to find someone who they know can do it. So I wouldn't say that there aren't people. Neither would I say that there are a lot of people who want the job. So I think that's probably what these alumni groups would be like.", "1826.0": "And I think, given my short stint in the university, six months, okay, not bad. I got past six months. So given my short stint in the university, I wrote on my LinkedIn. My LinkedIn said I was fine here. But I also got brackets here, I dropped out. Anyway, just saying.", "1842.0": "So the reality is, I think there are a lot of student groups, big and small. Some groups are not as sexy, not as interesting. Maybe like the otaku club, the Japanese culture club. It's like, okay, but anyway, I'm not judging otaku club, but you get the idea. It's just social context.", "1862.0": "So I think there are a lot of clubs in the university, or even if you don't have clubs in the university, you could always start your own interest group. Whether it's official or whether it's just an informal student community, I think that is all fine. And all these kind of alumni groups. Ultimately, the reality is, being in a university, there's just tons of little things that you can try and you can do. And if you fail, what happens? Just fail.", "1891.0": "There's not much impact in your CV. What happens? You just don't put in your CV. If you fail, then nobody knows this hot air balloon club that I started. It didn't become a thing. But when you start to go into the real world, or maybe not the real world, you start to establish your career, you start to go into the business world, or you embark on different professions of your own, then there's a whole different world of challenges here.", "1920.0": "And the impact of failure is much higher. So after a while, people start to become more and more safe. People are not willing to try and they don't do as much. In other words, they don't break through also because they're not willing to take calculated risk.", "1936.0": "So we'll take a break, we'll come back and after the break, we'll talk a little bit more about how can we better the university. And also talk a little bit more about now that all these young people are in the professional field, how can they thrive in this field? Okay, see you guys.", "1966.0": "Okay, so we are back from the break and yeah, so we want to, I want to hear a little bit. I think we've, we've, we've built a decent case for the value of university.", "1996.0": "But I'm also very certain that there are many aspects that the university can do better, which is why there is a growing voice about how the university is no longer as relevant today, which is also very real, right? There are a lot of things that I think they can become better.", "2010.0": "Right. So I want to hear from you, like, where do you think the university can, can better serve the needs of, you know, its students, which ultimately serves to help them have a head start in their career, right? Or become a professional in whatever field that they choose to be.", "2025.0": "Agree.", "2026.0": "Right. So, so in that sense, where do you think the university can do better?", "2030.0": "Right. I think that like, that's sort of like, a bit philosophical. But then, you know, like when you started like Oxford Cambridge, right? It's mainly natural sciences, natural philosophy, people just go there, rich people, right?", "2044.0": "Like, they have like, your governess, you know, in the house, and then they just come together, learn with your friends. And then those, these guys, like, really, they don't study anything, they study the entire world. And they just go on to become lawyers, take high positions in society.", "2060.0": "And then of course, like the Industrial Revolution, people came in, realized that, hey, the rise of middle class, and that were the people who started going to university and university started to change because then it started to be focused on the division of labor, and focusing on how do you build skills in each division of labor.", "2078.0": "And that's what universities really became and transformed into. And it's been always like this. And then it became more pronounced even to today, which is why let's say in SMU today, you have like operations management, but then operations management focused on supply chain, you know, like it's very specific, or like finance focused on private banking.", "2096.0": "So I think that that's where universities have really transformed to. But then back to your question on when next, right? I would say that it's really where I think that universities really have to disrupt itself, or else you'll die. And recently, there's a there's a meme going around, right? Harvard Business School is charging $50,000. And then that compares to Zoom, which is like, I think like what $40 a month. Yeah.", "2119.0": "Cozera and all the rest of the kind of things which you actually get the same skills, right? Because if Harvard Business School and all your other universities actually just doing online classes, like what's the difference between that and like studying for something as pre recorded? Yes. So I think that's, that's where universities are struggling right now in this period of time, a pandemic to sort of reinvent itself. And I think, on another note itself, like a bit of selling Koyuk from my side, because you know, I started KinoBee, right?", "2144.0": "So KinoBee is like this digital mentoring career platform that helps people to bridge that gap. And we acknowledge there's a gap, there's a gap between the university and the workplace. And that's why we're there, we're here to bridge that gap. And I think that for that, this is what we actually found, we found that the university itself is insufficient. And that's because people don't look at your grades anymore. It's important. But then as long as you meet sufficient ones, like maybe like you get above a second low, that's fine, you know, you show that you're good.", "2174.0": "You show that you're decently smart enough to actually sort of like do your work and then do the exams. And you're a sufficiently hard worker. That's all, you know, that's what it tells me about you. But it doesn't tell me anything more. Right? So what do I need more? I need to understand like, who you are as a person. When I put you in front of a client, what will you say? Do you have the EQ to like, you know, know when to respond? You know, things like that. Like, these are the things that a university degree doesn't teach you. And I think that that's where university can pivot there.", "2199.0": "But the thing about pivoting there is that it's tough because these universities are monoliths, right? They are already there for so long. They have huge reserves. They're essentially like a bank with all your money that they take inside, right? And they actually, they even have funds in universities. And some of these guys are LPs and private equity funds as well. Yeah. So Harvard Business School, Stanford, all these guys are actually putting your money that you actually put inside and deploying it to other things. Right? So that's, that's how they actually run.", "2228.0": "And NUS, we heard recently, you know, the Kongi case, right? And then he was compared to the NUS fund and so on. He didn't even realize how much funds NUS actually has. Right. And I think that when you have these amount of funds and people want to protect these funds, they don't innovate. It's very hard to innovate. It's very hard to turn around a huge ship versus let's say you are a small ship. You are something that just started. You don't have baggage. You can do things a lot faster. And I think that that's where universities might get disrupted. I'm not saying like people like Kenobi, maybe, you know, let's see how it goes.", "2258.0": "Right. But then it's, it's really, I'm not saying that, but actually I won. I'm trying to correct a bit, but actually, you know, I'm doing this so that I can disrupt the university in some way. Right. Yeah, of course. And I think that's where there are going to arise people like Kenobi across the world that actually want to do this.", "2277.0": "Yeah, I'm sure. And I do think for a little bit of a realistic check, you know, for a lot of people out there, it's like, you know, sometimes we ask ourselves why do we, why every generation needs to be doing more and more and more and more and more.", "2291.0": "Yeah, because it sounds like it. Right. And I think that is a reality, right. Because in the past you just need to, you know, as a guy, you just need to be decently strong. You can get a certain job. Right. But then over time things change and then you go to the polys, you go to universities and you're multilingual. Right. You got to do more and more and more and more.", "2307.0": "And that is, that is the nature of, you know, the workplace competition, right. Where, where, especially when a lot of technology platforms come into like essentially displace some of these old jobs, you know, that are very repetitive and it requires people to think, you know, and do more. Right. So do you subscribe to that, the central idea that, you know, you've got to do more and more. Right. Or is there another way around, you know, this way of life?", "2335.0": "I understand. I understand. I think this is a very complex question because one way you can look at it is that people say that, you know, you don't work hard, you work smart, right. You know, and that applies to much of life. I think that whether you're in finance or marketing or whether you're in supply chain, that is the rule, which is that it's not how hard you work, it's how you actually play the relationships and understand what is really needed to be done. Then you get promoted and then you get to the next level.", "2362.0": "But then the other way that I'm thinking about it is this idea that social mobility, because in the past it used to be that social mobility is between countries, a developed country versus a non-developed country or developing country. So you have like, let's say, you know, the workers and foreign workers in Singapore, they build up a nation, Bangladeshi workers. Some of them actually do have university degrees. They may not speak English very well, but then they do, are actually smart.", "2387.0": "They went to university and that to them, coming here to work is definitely providing more pay than going back home. And that works for Filipino maids as well. But then right now what we are seeing is a more drastic change, which is that even in Singapore, you have people with, or you may have people, may not be as trusting now, but you may have people in the future who have university degrees, maybe not from your NUS or SMU, but you're from your like more private universities who actually come from", "2417.0": "up and realise they don't have the jobs. And what do they have to do? With the rise of the gig economy, they actually go back and be, let's say, a Grab driver, just for interim, a transition kind of like job. But then this transition job doesn't provide the benefits that a normal job would have, like a CPF and so on. And under the constitution of Singapore and how the government views it is that Grab is really a transition job. That's why there isn't CPF benefits allocated to that. But then what happens when this transition job becomes a permanent one for 10 years?", "2447.0": "Yeah, or like for five years? What do we actually make out of it? How does the government make out of it? And I think that's very scary, because then that goes against what you just said, because you said that, you know, people are going to work harder with the things. And it's true, they're going to work harder. And they don't even use the university degree. Yeah, so I think that really is something which is scary. And that goes beyond universities really.", "2471.0": "Fair. I think that is a fair point. It's a complex question. And we really got to go deeper to distill, you know, the job market opportunity, you know, Singapore's position in the global standing, you know, and naturally, a lot of social policies that have come in, right, cannot cover, okay, today. But we will talk about it another time. Maybe we get a few professors, uni professors come in and discuss, right? I think that'll be fun.", "2499.0": "But on that note, right, from an individual's viewpoint, given the current reality of the job market, given the current reality, you know, you definitely sound like someone that is doing decently well, right out of the university, right? And like you just graduated.", "2515.0": "Yeah, fortunate too, I guess.", "2516.0": "Yeah, right. So, you know, fortunate is one way to look at it. There probably is a system behind this thing, right? So, in a way, right? So could you just kind of share with the audience a little bit, like, if you are trying to like find a good job, and you don't actually have that kind of experience in the field, you know, are there some tips and tricks that people can embark on?", "2540.0": "Okay, okay. I think one is definitely to be eager. To me, this idea of you as a startup is very important to me. I think that this is something, especially so in a gig economy.", "2551.0": "So you're saying that you've got to see yourself as a startup?", "2553.0": "Yes.", "2554.0": "Okay.", "2555.0": "Okay, to see yourself as a startup. And especially in a gig economy where, in a way, you're not going to rely on any firm. No firm is going to give you an iron rice bowl anymore. No firm is going to give you the, what, pension fund benefits anymore. It's different.", "2566.0": "Hey, hello, long ago, right?", "2568.0": "Yeah, long ago, it's gone. And right now, there's so devised contract jobs. I think that that really necessitates, I mean, beyond the social things you're talking about, which is another topic another day, how can I, as a person really deal with this is mainly to look at myself as a startup and to ask myself, how can I use my competitive advantage versus other people?", "2588.0": "What is my unique selling point? You know, what is the product, which is myself trying to solve? Like what solution in this world am I trying to solve with my own efforts and my own energies? And I think that if you can actually answer that question sufficiently well, and you can do it sufficiently well, you'll be paid for it. And especially so if you're doing something that nobody can do, right?", "2606.0": "Yeah.", "2607.0": "Yeah. And the more scarce the solution you're trying to solve, the higher you're paid. And it's, there's just a law of scarcity in nature.", "2615.0": "So how did you convince your employers to use you? Right? Because from what I know, the kind of deals that you guys are working on, you know, naturally in higher order, right? So that means the deal is quite big. It's complex deals, and big deals. And you're fronting a lot of these deals, but you're barely in your 30s, right? Late 20s. Right. So fresh out of university, a few years in the market, you know, how did you manage to convince your boss, you know, to use you? Share with us your story.", "2644.0": "Right. I think that like, if just like three short points, if I can actually mention, I think firstly, it is, you know, back to some of the things you talked about. One is pointing my employer to a myriad of experiences I had. I think that's, that's very important, because that shows that when you are in private equity, and you're in investments, you understand the market. And you understand it not from just one perspective, but you can look from different lenses.", "2673.0": "And that is interesting, because it means that you can understand what's happening next. And you can sort of like, do your, what is this term for it? But it's like, you know, this idea of innovation is actually not really innovation, but then you're actually just taking a perspective from another field and just applying it into this field. Yeah, so that's what you're doing. It's not really called innovation, but then not many people can do it. So, but if you can do it, and you can actually like do it properly, I think you will beat most people out there because everyone is very single track. Right? So I think that's, that's one.", "2704.0": "Second would be your networks. Because at the end of the day, when you do deals, and even not in not just doing deals, right, if you're just doing a normal, let's say finance function, you're just like calculating, let's say, the taxes in a company, and that's your only job. But the thing is, if you're just doing that job, you need to work together with everyone else. You need to work together with like the people who are doing the revenue department, you need to work together with the cost department, you need to work together with your CFO, you need to work together with all your other business functions to get that thing out.", "2731.0": "And that means that you need to talk to people, you need to make them a friend. Because why would they respond to you? Everyone's busy, right? They only respond to you because they know that, you know, you are someone that is important to them.", "2743.0": "In some way, they must also like you. I think there is some sort of social, you know, reality here. We are working with humans. We're not working with robots, right? It's not asking you to go and like, go and sarkang, you know, like, what's kind of like, you know, be what do they call that? What do you use to call that in the army? They call the person wayang.", "2762.0": "I'm not asking you to be a wayang, but at least, you know, you want to be a nice person. People are interested to work with you, you know, and at least be socially palatable. I think that's a very, very, especially to a lot of my friends out there that, you know, yeah, like the tech guys. It's like, it's a stereotype that people assume that tech guys are not sociable. And there's some basis to it, right? It's not the best thing to accept.", "2789.0": "Right. And in fact, I do know a lot of them that are working very hard to, you know, become more sociable, which is, which is very cool. You know, but I think across the fields, right, being socially likable, I think that is, that is important.", "2800.0": "Agree. And the third thing I would just mention, like, it seems all very broad. I mean, I can go in detail if you want, but then the third thing which I would say is most important is humility. I think it's a very overrated trait because when you're young, whether you like it or not, nobody thinks you're good, you know, like, like, as I tell any person who's going to intern is that like, you are a liability to the company. Let's face it, like, you know, like you're an intern, right? Like, what if someone want to hire you? Basically, the guy is taking off his time. Instead of doing the work, he's teaching you to do it.", "2830.0": "And he was going to screw up and he's going to check the work and he's going to ask you to do it again. And it sounds very painful for you, but it's more painful for the guy who is actually asking you to do the work. So I think that whenever you're starting out, the humility is a very important trait. And that continues even when you're older in a career, because I see a lot of rich people, a lot of like people who have done well, they have fallen, you know, they have fallen because they were proud.", "2854.0": "And because when they are proud, they tend to be complacent and they tend to think that they understand everything and they tend to miss the market. And this is where things really break down for them. And I think that humility is such an overrated trait. Everyone likes a person who is humble. I don't think that like anyone would disagree with me because any person, any employer, if you are humble and if you want, really want to learn, if you're hungry, why would I not like rather choose you than any other person?", "2881.0": "Because it just shows me that you are one that will make more bang for the buck.", "2886.0": "Fair, fair. I think that is a good point. I think to try to contextualize it, in other words, try to be more real. I think sometimes people try too hard to be someone they're not.", "2903.0": "And how I put it is, while I agree that humility is very charming, sometimes you don't fit this community or you don't fit this environment doesn't mean you cannot thrive in another environment.", "2914.0": "Yes.", "2915.0": "Right. You know, a lot of times when people go for an interview or when they're switching jobs, you know, they always feel like they're begging. You know, I always feel like, you know, I'm on the short end. But the reality is, if you are not, if this environment is not for you, you will never flourish.", "2929.0": "I think to sum it up today, maybe you can just share with us a little bit more about what you are doing and if they want to connect with you, where can they search for you?", "2938.0": "Right. Okay. So right now I started just two and a half months ago, Kinobi. So if Reginald knows about it, definitely. So we are a career mentoring platform. So special thing about us, we are totally digital.", "2951.0": "So totally digital mentoring platform, it's focused on a career, helping you get a best career. And that we are currently in three countries, Singapore, Indonesia, and India. And we currently have a few programs.", "2962.0": "So if I'd explain it very simply, we have two things. One is called Pathways and then the other one is called a mentoring program. So the Pathways part, how we started is very simple. You know, you're playing games, you know, like, I don't know about you, but then I played MapleStory when I was younger.", "2976.0": "You know, when you're 12, 13 years old, you're like, oh, you know, how do you, how do you build a Dexless Sin? You know, things like that.", "2981.0": "You know what I remember? I was a mage, right? I was a mage. I think I was ice, ice, ice and like, then I was playing. I was like, how come I'm always stuck here? Then all my friends become like job four, job three, job four.", "2997.0": "What the hell are you guys doing? You don't study. So I remember I was never very successful in MapleStory. But yes, yes.", "3006.0": "So you're like, you're like thinking of yourselves, you know, there are all these builds and stuff like that. Guides, you know, online telling you how do you, where do you fight monsters? Level 20, 30, like fight the green mushroom, you know, things like that.", "3016.0": "I've never met those guys. Maybe that's why I suck at the game, right?", "3020.0": "Maybe you should have met those guys.", "3021.0": "I've never met those guys. Okay.", "3023.0": "Yeah. So I realized that like, why not just build these guides for life, you know, then like just build like one for buyer banking, one for investment banking, a lot of people to experience different things.", "3032.0": "You know, like MapleStory, you can play different characters, right? You see, I'm playing the Icelandic mage. Then you can play the Sinner, right?", "3037.0": "You know, so like in this way, you can sort of like play different things and compare and contrast whether which one really vibes with you as a person.", "3045.0": "So I think that's one part of this. And second one is a mentoring program. So this one is of high order. Definitely. We are, we are a bit more exclusive and eventually it's hard to get inside.", "3054.0": "So we currently have one in TechBD. TechBD is a huge, huge thing now because technology firms are getting a lot of capital. They're the ones surviving COVID.", "3062.0": "And they're hiring.", "3064.0": "They're thriving. They're not surviving.", "3066.0": "Yes.", "3067.0": "They're doing very well.", "3068.0": "They're hiring a lot. So yeah, that's why we really started this. And if you really want to enter this industry, it's very soft skills related and we are here to help you.", "3076.0": "So I think that we have the mentors from like, let's say SAP, Alibaba Cloud, ByteDance, even GoPay. GoPay recently, part of GoJek, right? Became a unicorn.", "3086.0": "Yeah. So I think that's a huge, huge opportunity there. So we have all these mentors on board. Do come and join us.", "3094.0": "And you can actually sign up very simply. The link is very simple. It's bit.ly slash join-kenobi. And I think probably Reginald put in the show notes or something like that.", "3103.0": "Essentially, he's trying to tell me that I must put in show notes.", "3106.0": "Okay, bit.ly slash join-kenobi.", "3111.0": "Join-kenobi. K-I-N-O-B-I.", "3114.0": "Yes, correct.", "3115.0": "But I will still put in the show notes, right? So thanks for today. Thanks for joining us. And thank you for the military, for flying the fighter jet, you know, for National Day.", "3124.0": "Yes, soon.", "3126.0": "Soon. I think you guys will hear this episode after National Day, but thanks for sharing all your tips and tricks. And I hope you learn something useful today. See ya.", "3135.0": "Thank you. Bye.", "3136.0": "Bye.", "3166.0": "If you want to join our community telegram group, reach out to us on Facebook, Instagram. Everything is in the description below.", "3171.0": "If you enjoy the podcast and feel you want to keep us growing and stay independent, do buy us a coffee at ko-fi.com.", "3176.0": "With that, have a great day ahead. Stay tuned next week. And always remember, personal finance can be chilled, clear, and sustainable for all.", "3196.0": "Test, test. Okay, I hope Ben managed to convince you that, you know, there is some value in going to university, right?", "3202.0": "We're not saying that you must go or you need, die, die, you need to go. No. We're just trying to present the other side of the case so that you get a, you know, a clearer picture.", "3211.0": "And then you make a decision of your own, whether does it fit you, whether does it fit your goals, right?", "3215.0": "So I hope that's helpful for you. And for next week, next week we're going to continue to roll on investment-related content.", "3223.0": "I know many of you guys are trying to learn how to invest and, you know, trying to pick stocks and, you know, if not, pick ETFs or pick REITs, you know, whatever.", "3232.0": "And if you are not interested to pick, it's also okay. You should continue to listen because you get a better idea of what are the underlying things that you look at, right?", "3241.0": "So that you can, you know, essentially find a clearer, you know, management, you know, manager or whether they're robo-advisor or whatever, right?", "3249.0": "Essentially to help you manage your investments. And in next week's content, we're going to talk about the qualitative factors, right?", "3255.0": "Three qualitative factors that I use to decide what stocks do I pick.", "3261.0": "Truth be told, 20-30 minutes cannot tell you everything, but I'm going to give you all the important terms that you can go and search for and get a better idea over time, right?", "3270.0": "This is also a reaction to this guy that gave me one star on Apple Reviews.", "3277.0": "Say, previously we published a topic about, you know, how three things you must have to be a good stock picker.", "3286.0": "And the first point was luck because I honestly believe that if you cannot grapple with the idea of luck, if everything is signs to you, then you will struggle.", "3296.0": "You know, and this guy went on our Apple Podcast Review and gave us a one star. A bit sad, so hot.", "3301.0": "Yeah, if you're still listening, I hope you enjoy next week's episode and can review us. Give us five stars, okay?", "3308.0": "But anyway, I just want to also humble flex that we actually know what we're saying, okay?", "3312.0": "We're not like professionals, but we're enthusiasts and we don't think we are\u2026", "3317.0": "I personally don't think that I'm talking cock, okay? Sometimes I am, but yeah, on the theme of investments,", "3325.0": "we make sure that the things that we publish to you are of quality.", "3329.0": "So next week, we're going to talk about the qualitative factors so that you can be a better stock picker.", "3335.0": "See ya next week!"}}]}
