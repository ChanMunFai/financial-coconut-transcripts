        "0.0": "Test, test, good morning everyone!",
        "4.32": "I welcome you to another day with the Financial Coconut.",
        "7.68": "In our podcast, we'll be debunking financial myths, discovering best financial practices,",
        "12.76": "discussing financial strategies that fits our unique life.",
        "16.64": "You get it!",
        "17.64": "Ultimately empowering us to create a life we love, while managing our finances well.",
        "22.56": "So whether you're interested in the pursuit of the common narrative, getting a degree,",
        "26.24": "finding a job, setting up a family and live happily ever after.",
        "29.2": "Or you're an avid FIRE believer, F-I-R-E, for those who are new to the term, FIRE means",
        "34.8": "Financial Independence Retire Early.",
        "37.12": "Or you're just quirky, like me, questioning and trying to create a life you love.",
        "41.84": "There should be something for you here.",
        "44.16": "So whether you're on your way to work, to school, chilling by the beach or just cuddling,",
        "48.36": "snuggling in bed, today's topic is 3 things you should include in your budget.",
        "56.8": "Following the previous episode of Dangerous Spending Myths, I talked about 3 different",
        "62.24": "spending myths that to me are extremely dangerous if you're trying to become more financially",
        "66.96": "literate and drive yourself towards financial independence and early retirement.",
        "73.16": "And so if you have not caught the topic, you know, have not caught that podcast, you may",
        "77.44": "want to check out the previous series.",
        "79.48": "But I want to elaborate a little bit more on that last point that I said last week,",
        "84.44": "which is I believe that spending smart is so much more important than not spending.",
        "92.64": "And not spending is not going to get you rich, in my view.",
        "95.56": "We can calculate.",
        "97.12": "And it's not going to get you really, really wealthy.",
        "99.96": "But then again, you don't need to be really wealthy to live a great life.",
        "104.52": "But to me, that is a very weird underlying spending myth that many of us have.",
        "109.64": "So today I've decided that, yeah, then I should talk a little bit about my budget.",
        "114.92": "How do I spend my money?",
        "116.4": "And 3 things that I feel it's not included in many people's budget.",
        "120.88": "And why you should include these 3 things in your budget.",
        "124.92": "How do we spend smart?",
        "126.4": "How do we spend better to be able to then attain what we want and to be able to be smarter",
        "133.2": "with our finances?",
        "134.52": "Once again, it's not about not spending, it's about spending smart.",
        "138.32": "More parents and more family and more.",
        "141.0": "All of us should talk more about how do we spend?",
        "144.0": "How do we spend better?",
        "145.0": "How do we become smart spenders?",
        "147.4": "And the first thing that I want you to include in your budget, not surprisingly, is a book fund.",
        "155.28": "Hehe.",
        "156.28": "Throughout my podcast, I've consistently talked about you read books, read books, read books.",
        "163.28": "Go to the library, get free books or buy books or buy this book, get that book.",
        "168.16": "You get the idea.",
        "169.16": "I believe that reading has its beauty.",
        "172.48": "Honestly, I didn't start out reading.",
        "175.76": "I don't come from a family of avid readers.",
        "177.96": "We don't read everyday.",
        "178.96": "We watch cartoons, Digimon, Pokemon, growing up, card capture Sakura, right?",
        "185.68": "So we don't read a lot.",
        "188.0": "And how did I picked up reading was when I joined a scam, the accidental scam that I",
        "193.16": "joined.",
        "194.16": "And I was assigned a mentor.",
        "195.16": "So my mentor said, hey, you got to read this books.",
        "197.84": "Come to think of it, scam also got mentor.",
        "201.2": "Yeah, I know I've not talked about that yet.",
        "203.56": "We'll talk about it in a later episode.",
        "205.8": "But yes, that is the good thing that came out of it.",
        "208.64": "I picked up the habit of reading and I've realized that it is not because I don't like",
        "212.88": "to read.",
        "213.88": "I used to think I don't like to read.",
        "215.4": "It was just because I've not found something that I love reading.",
        "220.04": "And I don't like to read fantasy.",
        "222.44": "I don't like to read stories because I just cannot imagine.",
        "227.56": "I'm just not wired that way.",
        "229.6": "And I've not cultivated the capacity to imagine based on just reading lines.",
        "235.96": "So I fell in love with reading nonfiction, a lot of biographies, a lot of different kind",
        "241.96": "of success books that some people call self-help, all those kind of stuff.",
        "247.24": "I fell in love with reading them.",
        "250.84": "I've consistently read over the years.",
        "253.08": "I've got great friends that have great books.",
        "255.04": "They're always spending on books and always lending it to me.",
        "259.28": "But I also spend on my books.",
        "261.2": "I spend on a few books that are pretty pricey and not many people buy them like my investing",
        "266.76": "books.",
        "267.76": "Average are going to like 50, 60, hundreds of dollars.",
        "272.16": "You get the idea.",
        "273.32": "Some of the books are a little bit more expensive.",
        "275.64": "And yes, if you can get it from the library, go ahead.",
        "278.2": "But you realize that the library has its limits at times.",
        "282.12": "If you really want to learn something, learn something fast, and just so happen that the",
        "285.76": "library doesn't have the book or the book is consistently being leased out, you could",
        "290.24": "save with the library of course.",
        "291.96": "But if it's not available, you may want to consider spending a little bit and buy.",
        "296.44": "I think it's cool.",
        "297.44": "And a book is a good gift also.",
        "298.92": "If you buy the book and you like the book, you can always gift it to someone.",
        "302.8": "It's like gifting knowledge.",
        "304.44": "I like it.",
        "305.44": "I like that way.",
        "306.44": "I've been gifting books for a really long time and I enjoy it.",
        "310.76": "I'm going to further emphasize as to why I believe you should read books.",
        "316.44": "These days there are many ways to learn.",
        "317.92": "You could go on the internet, watch some videos on YouTube, or listen to my podcast, listen",
        "323.36": "to other podcasts.",
        "324.36": "If you're listening on Spotify, you realize that hey, there are tons of good podcasts",
        "328.32": "here and of course, even in SoundCloud, there are many other places that have great podcasts.",
        "333.96": "I think in our part of the world, we're not listening to enough podcasts.",
        "338.36": "So maybe you want to listen to more.",
        "339.76": "I get it.",
        "340.76": "Videos, audios, great way to learn.",
        "343.96": "So many platforms, Udemy, Skillshare, all these different places, amazing ways to learn.",
        "350.32": "But why I think books are still very fundamental, because think about it, where do all these",
        "355.04": "people get their knowledge?",
        "357.36": "Many of them got it from books.",
        "360.4": "Why?",
        "361.6": "Books take a long time to publish and it takes a lot of capital to publish books.",
        "366.52": "So to be able to get a publisher to publish, there's a whole process of proofreading, of",
        "373.6": "editing and making sure everything is accurate and up to standard, which is why to me, books",
        "381.08": "have the most rigorous process of putting information together, rather than podcast,",
        "388.32": "rather than video.",
        "389.68": "All these are great platforms.",
        "390.96": "Don't get me wrong, I'm a podcaster.",
        "393.8": "But where do we get our knowledge?",
        "396.2": "We get from books.",
        "397.2": "So I think you should read books because they're the most rigorous.",
        "400.76": "And that's why you should add a book fund into your monthly spending.",
        "405.04": "Why not?",
        "406.04": "Read some books, pick up something.",
        "408.48": "And you don't need to read self-help or investing books all the time.",
        "414.72": "Start with something that you love.",
        "416.24": "Pick up a book about coffee, pick up a book about tea, pick up a book about photography.",
        "421.2": "Photography books are quite expensive.",
        "423.56": "So pick up a book about something you love and start there.",
        "427.2": "It's a great place to learn.",
        "428.2": "The content is a lot more rigorous than what you get online.",
        "431.8": "And it's not that expensive.",
        "432.8": "One of the cheapest ways to learn are by books.",
        "435.68": "So I feel one of the things that you should include in your budget is a book fund.",
        "440.68": "Do it.",
        "441.68": "And the next thing that I feel you should include in your budget is this thing that",
        "445.64": "I call an exploration fund.",
        "448.44": "Yeah, yeah.",
        "450.68": "Exploration explore what, right?",
        "453.0": "How many of you on the other end have ever came across this thought that, oh my goodness,",
        "457.36": "I'm so bored.",
        "459.28": "Work is so boring.",
        "460.28": "It's the same thing again and again and again.",
        "463.48": "And I'm burning out.",
        "464.48": "I want to try something new.",
        "465.56": "I want to take on a different job.",
        "466.84": "I want to shift my career.",
        "467.84": "I want to change this.",
        "468.84": "I want to do that.",
        "470.2": "I'm quite sure at least 80 to 90% of you guys have experienced something like that.",
        "476.16": "It's fair, especially when you're really good at what you do.",
        "479.08": "And to me, that is where boredom comes from.",
        "483.72": "You're so good at what you do.",
        "485.12": "You've been doing it again and again and again and again and again and again.",
        "487.64": "You get bored.",
        "488.64": "It's like playing games, right?",
        "490.0": "You play a game.",
        "491.0": "At first, very exciting.",
        "492.32": "But after a while, you know how to play the game.",
        "494.2": "Oh my goodness, so boring now.",
        "496.44": "Sian already, right?",
        "497.44": "You want to quit the game.",
        "498.6": "And then you find another game and it looks interesting.",
        "500.76": "And then you realize, oh, this game, even easier to crack.",
        "503.98": "After a while, you get bored.",
        "505.56": "You delete it.",
        "506.56": "Same idea.",
        "507.56": "So when you get bored, when you get so good at something, you become bored.",
        "511.18": "And you think that you want to change it.",
        "512.94": "You think that you want to make progress, which is fair.",
        "517.18": "But in a job setting or in your financial health, many a times, that may not be the",
        "521.38": "wisest choice.",
        "523.42": "If you really feel that you want to move on from your job, cool, go ahead.",
        "527.1": "If you really feel that you want to take on something new, you want to start a new challenge,",
        "530.22": "you want to start a new startup, you want to start working.",
        "535.74": "You want to start a company, you want to change a department, you want to promote and progress,",
        "538.62": "create cool stuff, do what you believe.",
        "541.5": "But recognize that many a times, it is just our underlying boredom disturbing us.",
        "548.38": "And to me, I believe that there is an underlying desire for progress in all of us.",
        "554.78": "That is why we get to where we are.",
        "556.94": "That's why the human civilization is where we are today.",
        "560.02": "And I stand by it.",
        "561.74": "Because if you think about it, even if people tell you, oh, I'm retired, they're actually",
        "565.1": "making progress in other aspects of life.",
        "567.22": "They're trying to make progress in their relationships, they're trying to make progress in their health,",
        "571.82": "they're trying to make progress in their interests, they're trying to become a hobbyist.",
        "576.26": "We're all wanting to make progress.",
        "578.02": "We all need to work, we all want to make progress, we just focus on different things at different",
        "582.62": "time in life.",
        "584.1": "So to me, we get bored.",
        "586.14": "And we don't exactly need to change our job or quit our job just because we are bored.",
        "591.34": "We just need to solve that boredom.",
        "594.38": "So include an exploration fund.",
        "596.9": "It could be $100, it could be $50, depending on what is comfortable in your budget.",
        "603.98": "And explore something.",
        "605.18": "Buy a new board game, go for a new class, pick up a new sport, try a new thing.",
        "612.14": "Yeah, that is the idea of exploration, trying something that you've never tried before.",
        "617.22": "And that will make sure you're not bored at all.",
        "619.1": "You will never get bored if you can consistently explore.",
        "622.06": "It is because when we start working, we dedicate so much of our lives to work.",
        "626.86": "We dedicate 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours, my goodness, I have friends who work in accounting,",
        "632.46": "big 4, like 16 hours to work, almost every day I work.",
        "637.66": "Yeah, and we dedicate so much time to work, after that we go home, we sleep, we end up",
        "642.38": "not socialising with our friends as much, we start to skip the gym, we start to do this,",
        "647.58": "we start to drop a lot of things that we used to have.",
        "650.86": "And that's why we get bored very easily, alright, because there's nothing new in our life,",
        "655.18": "every day is just work, ma.",
        "656.78": "So why not spend a little bit of budget to explore?",
        "660.06": "Give yourself that $50, that $100, do spontaneous things, go rock climbing, go for, learn how",
        "665.74": "to dance, pick up a ballet, or, you know, join a new board game group, buy a new board",
        "671.5": "game, go for archery, or learn how to code, play chess, anything and everything under",
        "678.38": "the sky, there's so many platforms that you can do.",
        "681.02": "I would recommend you to use meetup.com, search on Eventbrite, I think Facebook have a lot",
        "686.3": "of good events also, but set aside a budget for you to do random things and for you to",
        "690.46": "explore.",
        "691.1": "That will make your life a lot more exciting, a lot more fun, and less bored.",
        "695.18": "You will not really need to keep changing jobs.",
        "697.9": "And why do I try to let you realise this thing?",
        "701.58": "Because if you stick to something long enough, you level up, you become that much better",
        "708.46": "and you get to progress.",
        "711.1": "Yes, of course you can always change your job and progress, or you can start a new company",
        "715.5": "and progress, fair.",
        "716.94": "But I think some governing fundamentals is that if you stick to something long enough,",
        "721.82": "you become an expert, you become that good at it, you can start to see more things, the",
        "726.06": "ins and the outs, and you get more opportunities because you are that good at it.",
        "730.46": "So don't always change your job just because you are bored.",
        "733.42": "Recognise that you are bored because you are not exploring and set aside a budget, go and",
        "737.82": "try something new and explore.",
        "739.42": "Fair?",
        "739.98": "Yeah, give it a shot and let me know what you have tried, let me know interesting things",
        "744.06": "that you have done.",
        "745.02": "Email me or Facebook message me, okay?",
        "747.34": "I want to get some ideas as to what kind of interesting things I can do.",
        "751.5": "Singapore, KL, anywhere, I am open to ideas.",
        "755.02": "The last thing that I feel you should include in your budget is something I call giving.",
        "761.9": "Yeah, yeah, a bit cheesy, a lot of people say you must give back to society, give to",
        "766.06": "charity, give all those kind of different things.",
        "769.26": "But in my view, giving is just something that allows me to realise certain fundamentals",
        "775.26": "of society, certain fundamentals of life.",
        "779.34": "That everything is but a gift.",
        "781.42": "If we realise it is all in a circle, we are where we are because we are given an opportunity,",
        "786.3": "we are where we are because we are given a good education, we are where we are because",
        "790.46": "our parents had a good time at night and gave birth to us.",
        "794.38": "So everything is a process of giving and it is a cycle.",
        "798.14": "Many a times if we keep taking and taking and taking and we stop giving, we realise",
        "802.46": "that this is a cycle, we stop realising that we are so connected in actuality to people",
        "809.02": "around us, to things around us, to the environment and to every little thing.",
        "813.98": "We are all connected and giving helps you to do that.",
        "818.38": "I am not saying giving in a sense that you need to buy a rice, buy a huge 25kg of rice",
        "824.06": "to donate to the temple or go to invest to donate to a charity, to go for different kind",
        "831.1": "of causes, you don't need to do that.",
        "833.26": "Giving is just giving.",
        "835.58": "You could buy a gift, maybe your colleagues, they have worked really hard, buy them a gift,",
        "844.06": "maybe it can be a bubble tea, oh my goodness, why did I say bubble tea?",
        "847.82": "Oh yeah, it is just an act of giving.",
        "850.54": "Or maybe it is the cleaning auntie downstairs that is always cleaning the tables and making",
        "857.34": "sure the hawker centre is clean or decently clean.",
        "860.22": "Trust me, they don't make a lot, we will talk about that in another episode.",
        "863.82": "But yeah, buy them a coffee, buy them a loaf of bread, give them some biscuits, just give",
        "869.1": "something.",
        "869.9": "You don't need to go the really extra mile to give, do little acts of giving.",
        "875.34": "Oh, give your mum a hug, yeah I have not given my mum a hug in a long time, I probably should.",
        "880.94": "Just anything, just give.",
        "883.98": "And honestly, giving, you don't really need a lot of money but why not set aside a budget",
        "888.14": "to give, give more and realise that everything is a cycle.",

        "908.62": "Essentially, it is some people that donated their fridge and the town council has allowed",
        "916.22": "them to put these fridges at certain locations in Tampines, which uses the town council electricity,",
        "924.94": "it is a place where you can give your vegetables, you buy extra veggies, you can give, you buy",
        "931.74": "extra oatmeal, you can give, you cook extra pastries, cakes, you can give and you can",
        "937.82": "just put inside the fridge and most of the time, these fridges are located in places",

        "951.18": "good things that you, great food and good things that you give them.",
        "954.78": "So yeah, I want to point this out and I feel it is a great initiative and I feel that more",
        "959.26": "estates should do it and Tampines should expand this My Kind Fridge initiative.",
        "963.9": "So search about them online, they have a few news around and if you are around, you are",
        "969.1": "near a kind fridge and you are shopping for vegetables, buying chicken, why not do a little",
        "974.14": "bit more, right?",

        "0.0": "So many financial gurus or financial educators always tell you that you're not going to spend",
        "5.84": "less, you're going to spend less, cut your expenses because that's the only thing that's",
        "9.6": "truly within your control and they're not wrong.",
        "13.36": "To cut back on drinking, cut back on gatherings out there and essentially just consume less.",
        "19.68": "You're going to get more surplus, you're going to be able to invest more, going to be able",
        "23.44": "to save more and prepare for retirement.",
        "25.9": "You may even be able to retire early, get your house earlier and buy things that may",
        "31.94": "be more impactful for the longer term.",
        "35.02": "So all these are not wrong but it's really painful spending less from time to time.",
        "39.06": "It's like, oh my god, I'm on a budget, oh I'm on a budget.",
        "42.42": "So many people get turned off by this word budget.",
        "45.26": "It's like, oh shit, no man, don't tell me to go on a budget thing.",
        "49.86": "And there's a lot of assumption that when things are on a budget, it's going to be sub-quality,",
        "54.26": "it's going to be painful, it's going to be like a chore.",
        "58.3": "But today I'm going to debunk all that and talk about how we're going to have fun on",
        "62.06": "a budget in Singapore.",
        "65.78": "So good morning everyone, I welcome you to another day with the Financial Coconut.",
        "69.78": "In our podcast, we'll be debunking financial myths, discovering best financial practices,",
        "74.86": "discussing financial strategies that fits our unique life.",
        "78.44": "You get it.",
        "79.44": "Ultimately empowering us to create a life we love while managing our finances well.",
        "83.74": "And today's topic, how to have fun on a budget in Singapore.",
        "88.42": "Some say the world's most expensive city.",
        "91.54": "Yeah.",
        "92.54": "Growing up in Singapore, you may or may not have felt that things were really expensive.",
        "99.34": "And honestly, when I was growing up, I didn't feel it because there was no mode for comparison.",
        "103.66": "It was just like, oh, okay, this is how things were.",
        "106.42": "These are how prices are.",
        "108.26": "But when I started traveling and I had more access to a lot more information, I realized",
        "113.38": "that in Singapore, things are truly pricey relative to many other of our neighboring",
        "118.5": "countries because we don't grow our stuff.",
        "121.6": "We import many things and we tax certain things.",
        "125.18": "You know, that's why alcohol is really expensive.",
        "127.94": "Cigarettes are really expensive.",
        "128.94": "You know, food items in general are expensive.",
        "131.94": "We have a lot of people living on a small island.",
        "135.6": "So honestly, without the housing scheme, without the HDB scheme, most people will never be",
        "140.22": "able to afford houses because private condominiums are going at like a million, close to two.",
        "146.02": "And HDB is getting really expensive also.",
        "149.14": "From what I found out from my dad when he first got his first HDB, that was about 20",
        "153.58": "odd years ago, it was a four room flat for 109,000 in Tampines.",
        "160.82": "And today, my goodness, houses average are going at about four, five, 600,000.",
        "167.14": "If you want to do like 300,000, you got to go really, really far out to Sembawang or something.",
        "172.94": "But yeah, housing is just one thing.",
        "174.54": "And then there's like transportation.",
        "177.04": "Most people don't own a car because it's really expensive.",
        "181.38": "Most people just take the public transport.",
        "183.06": "It's more efficient, cheap, and relatively cheap.",
        "186.58": "And yeah, you get the idea.",
        "188.4": "So it is not wrong to say that many things in Singapore are expensive.",
        "192.9": "One of the most important thing to do is to watch our budget.",
        "197.92": "But that's not to say that being a little bit more penny pinching means you're going",
        "202.94": "to reduce your quality of life.",
        "205.5": "In the past, I remember when I was in school and I see people bring lunch boxes to school",
        "210.42": "and I'll judge them as like, hey, well, I was so...",
        "214.06": "You know no money to buy food, must pack food from home.",
        "217.82": "But now when I see people bring food to the office, I'll be like, oh my, you're so lucky",
        "222.34": "you managed to find time to do good food and bring a great lunch box to work.",
        "228.54": "So it's a mindset shift and it really depends on how you value different things.",
        "233.18": "And when I learned to value things like quality and health and many other different things",
        "239.78": "on other than just price, which I talk a little bit about.",
        "244.82": "One of the spending myths that we have today is that more expensive means better.",
        "249.64": "So yeah, backtrack to the episode on spending myths and to me that is like, oh, so terrible",
        "255.32": "because we don't factor in things like branding, we don't factor in things like rent, we don't",
        "260.16": "factor in things like, you know, many other different small elements that all these businesses",
        "265.32": "have to put in to command that price.",
        "268.32": "But many a times, if you're just looking at quality, you can do a lot of great things",
        "271.72": "on your own.",
        "273.08": "So yeah, don't be fooled by the whole idea of more expensive means better.",
        "277.64": "It really depends on how you value things and yeah, I personally believe that if you",
        "283.0": "go down to revalue the way we look at things, you come to a lot more emotional calm when",
        "288.76": "looking at different aspects of life.",
        "291.6": "And so when I look at this, I come to a question like, hmm, so how do I have fun in Singapore",
        "297.24": "then?",
        "298.24": "If everything is so expensive and I'm on a budget, how am I going to have fun?",
        "302.32": "So of course there are a lot of interesting places like the museum that you can go is",
        "306.24": "free.",
        "307.24": "National Arts Council gives free museum pass to everybody that's a Singaporean.",
        "311.24": "And there are a lot of activities out there that are free.",
        "314.6": "A lot of events going around and yeah, great places to go about.",
        "319.16": "But there are some things that you may not have thought about and I want to share with",
        "322.6": "you some things that I do, which I thought was really, really fun.",
        "325.4": "And the first thing I do is I'll join an interest group, a social community in fact, on meetup.com.",
        "332.9": "So I know I've talked about meetup.com and I want to share with you some of my experiences",
        "336.58": "on meetup.com.",
        "338.02": "So I've joined a few meetups and it's really, really fun.",
        "341.02": "One of the most memorable meetup that I've joined was this board game meetup group.",
        "346.5": "And what happened was I needed to pay $5 for a four-hour session at this board game place",
        "353.54": "in Marina South MRT station.",
        "358.82": "It's organised by an interest group where it's filled with board game lovers and it's",
        "363.14": "amazing because they all know how to play.",
        "365.5": "I was like one of the few noobs.",
        "367.34": "I knew nothing.",
        "368.34": "And I went there, all I did was pay $5 and I met like 40, 60 people.",
        "372.54": "They're all playing board games and many of them come as an individual.",
        "375.74": "And when I think about it, oh my goodness, it was very, very difficult to gather four",
        "380.3": "or five people to go to a board game cafe and play.",
        "383.26": "But on this meetup group, I managed to just pay a minimal, even cheaper than how I'll",
        "388.26": "usually pay at the board game cafe and be able to play all these different games with",
        "393.7": "all these different people that knew so much about board games and they taught me all these",
        "398.42": "different games and it was really fun.",
        "400.1": "So it was like a great social activity and it's a lot, very, very affordable.",
        "404.54": "And because it is an interest group, they're not profit-driven.",
        "407.3": "Although it is at a place which is a board game, which is kind of like a board game cafe,",
        "411.54": "more like a board game community area.",
        "414.62": "So it's kind of like a collaboration with that space and the interest group.",
        "419.22": "But because the interest group is not profit-driven, they managed to strike a deal with the board",
        "423.06": "game space owner.",
        "426.34": "And yeah, everyone was paying minimal to get maximum amount of joy.",
        "430.06": "I was like, wow, it's cool, man.",
        "431.7": "$5, I can do so.",
        "432.98": "I can have a great afternoon on the weekend, meet so many people and play board games.",
        "438.26": "I thought that was cool.",
        "440.02": "And there were a lot of other groups that I joined.",
        "442.66": "Some of the groups were ramen group.",
        "444.7": "So essentially, it's just a bunch of people that really love eating ramen and they go",
        "448.38": "out and have fun together by eating ramen, go to different places and have ramen together.",
        "452.9": "I was like, hey, it's pretty nice, man.",
        "454.98": "Yeah, I just get to try different, different ramen.",
        "457.94": "It's not exactly cheap, cheap per se, but there's a lot of social activity around and",
        "462.66": "you don't need to spend a lot of money.",
        "464.22": "Just over a bowl of ramen, people chat about all sorts of stuff.",
        "468.22": "And on meetup.com, I think there are a lot of interesting groups.",
        "471.58": "I saw one that was about social dancing and there was another one about language.",
        "475.86": "You could gather with a bunch of people that are interested in Japanese lessons, learning",
        "480.78": "Japanese and just have fun together, talk, speak in Japanese and be able to use that",
        "488.5": "language that you're interested in.",
        "490.18": "So to me, it's like, wow, I don't need to spend much money because all these interest",
        "494.06": "groups are not profit driven.",
        "496.22": "They are interest driven.",
        "497.22": "They're just trying to gather people that are interested on the same thing to come together",
        "500.66": "and have fun, connect and be better together.",
        "503.74": "So on a budget, wow, great stuff.",
        "506.34": "Five dollars, ten dollars, twenty dollars, nothing much.",
        "508.74": "And you can do great things on the weekend.",
        "510.42": "So why not pick up the app meetup.com, join the interest group and have fun.",
        "515.5": "Go and do it.",
        "516.5": "And let me know if you found any interesting things on the app or join any interesting",
        "520.88": "social groups that I could then recommend to friends and family and maybe some of you",
        "525.1": "guys here too.",
        "526.9": "And the next point that I feel many people have not used a lot is to make use of public",
        "533.18": "spaces.",
        "534.18": "Yeah, I get it.",
        "536.54": "You may not like public spaces because many times they are out in the open, they may be",
        "540.42": "a bit warm and we live in the tropics, it gets a little warm.",
        "544.7": "So yeah, I get it.",
        "546.9": "But have you thought of picnicking during the evening?",
        "550.54": "There's a lot of media that shows you that you need to picnic early in the morning, everyone",
        "556.1": "wakes up early in the morning, go for a picnic.",
        "558.54": "And I was like, oh my goodness, in Singapore you don't do that because if you meet up at",
        "562.74": "8, by the time it's 10, it's going to be super warm.",
        "565.42": "You want to stay away from all these grass patches.",
        "569.42": "But have you tried picnicking on the evening?",
        "571.42": "I've tried it and I loved it.",
        "573.18": "So it's like sunset and my friends were just gathering around and we're all just chatting",
        "576.82": "and everybody bring a little bit of food and just have fun.",
        "580.7": "The Botanical Gardens is beautiful, McRitchie, it's very nice.",
        "584.3": "We have a lot of public spaces around that are beautifully done, so why not make use",
        "589.74": "of it?",
        "590.74": "And if the circumstances doesn't allow you to go out in the morning, then go out in the",
        "594.46": "evening.",
        "595.46": "Nobody says that you cannot go picnic in the evening, nobody says you cannot go for a stroll",
        "598.9": "in the evening if you're trying to avoid the sun.",
        "602.34": "So we have great beaches, we have great parks and I feel extremely underutilised.",
        "607.9": "When I ask my friends, hey, you want to go to the beach or you want to go to the parks",
        "611.5": "or you want to go to the gardens, many people will be like, are you sure?",
        "615.86": "So boring.",
        "617.42": "But when I look at it, all these are just great places to hang out and connect.",
        "622.42": "I don't need to do another activity just to...",
        "625.22": "I don't need to go to a cafe or go to a movie.",
        "630.34": "Once in a while I do that, but it's not like an every week thing.",
        "632.66": "I'm amazed how people go for cafe hops.",
        "637.7": "One afternoon they do three, four cafes.",
        "639.66": "I'm like, are you serious?",
        "640.66": "You're going to spend a ton and most of these cafes, they suck.",
        "645.06": "They don't make great coffee, they don't make great pastry, many things are outsourced.",
        "649.34": "I will do an episode to share with you more about why I don't think you should go to a",
        "652.9": "cafe and why you shouldn't start a cafe, but that's in a later stage.",
        "657.52": "So yeah, make use of public spaces.",
        "659.02": "Go to the library, go to the parks, go to the beach.",
        "661.82": "In some way you are paying for it because you pay taxes.",
        "665.5": "But in many other ways, it's kind of free.",
        "667.3": "Since you already paid taxes for it, why not use it?",
        "669.74": "It's great stuff.",
        "670.74": "If you're on a budget, you can still do a lot of things.",
        "673.74": "And actually many of these interest groups make use of public spaces.",
        "677.22": "So yeah, other than joining an interest group, other than making use of public spaces, one",
        "681.74": "thing you could do, which I feel we've not been doing a lot, is to potluck at your friend's",
        "685.82": "place.",
        "686.82": "Yeah, to me it's like, it used to be a thing.",
        "689.22": "I don't know about you, but when I was younger, we would always hang out at my friend's place,",
        "692.7": "different friends.",
        "694.7": "School days, right?",
        "696.38": "After exams, we would just stay overnight at one of my friend's place, play games, play",
        "701.02": "mahjong, sing song overnight, whatever, do all sorts of random things.",
        "705.66": "And it feels as if as we grow older, we stop hanging out at our friend's place.",
        "710.7": "It feels like we need to go out there and find a place together.",
        "714.9": "And to me it's like, oh, why not just go to a friend's place?",
        "718.94": "It's great, right?",
        "719.94": "We have had great experiences doing that.",
        "721.78": "It makes things really affordable.",
        "723.66": "You don't need to pay for all the premium outside because of space, and just hang out",
        "727.42": "and chill, and you can be all shabby and simple and basic and just hang around.",
        "734.02": "So I've been actively trying to do that more.",
        "736.98": "And yeah, it's really, really nice.",
        "738.1": "I always try to get my friends to come over to my place and try to get them to open up",
        "742.54": "their space for us together.",
        "745.66": "Some people, like when I'm a host, I will make sure I tell my friends that you can come",
        "749.78": "over, feel free.",
        "750.78": "I love having you coming over.",
        "752.82": "I have great tea.",
        "753.82": "You don't need to go out there and spend a lot of money on very terrible teas that have",

        "127.64": "You want to buy this thing, you want to do that thing.",

        "135.56": "to use it.",
        "136.56": "So it's nice.",
        "137.92": "And then on the other end, there are some people that are so afraid to spend and they",
        "143.16": "have a very unhealthy relationship with their money and it pains them when they save but",
        "148.84": "they still save.",
        "149.84": "So I have a friend who told me recently, he's like, you know, I really try to save but every",

        "168.16": "And to me, that is very unhealthy as well.",

        "179.92": "I think that is where we are looking at.",

        "228.64": "the same time taking good care of myself?",
        "230.44": "And today, I'm going to share with you three tips that I thought long and hard and I use",

        "235.96": "So it's cool.",
        "236.96": "If you have any other tips on your end, I want to hear from you.",
        "240.12": "How do you become a smart saver?",
        "242.8": "And the first thing that I'm going to share with you is to automate your savings contribution.",
        "249.12": "Save before you spend.",
        "250.72": "This is extremely important.",
        "252.28": "I know in Singapore, there's this shop and save.",
        "254.68": "I used to have this supermarket called shop and save.",
        "257.64": "But if you think about it, if you shop, you're not actually saving, you're shopping.",
        "262.56": "What you need to do is save and shop, right?",
        "265.8": "You want to be able to commit to your savings goal or any of these other big ticket purchases",
        "271.88": "whether it's your further development fund or whether it's your mortgage fund, right",
        "276.36": "from the beginning, right from the start.",
        "278.08": "So every month when the money comes into your paycheck bank account, you want to be able",
        "282.92": "to automatically transfer all these money to your savings account or to your various",
        "287.88": "funds accounts.",
        "289.44": "So that is not difficult these days because it's getting really easy to set auto transfers.",
        "294.56": "The banking back ends are a lot easier.",
        "297.64": "So do it.",
        "298.64": "Automated transfers will help you to stay committed to whatever you want to do.",
        "303.2": "So if you want to save money, go and open a new bank account and set that as a savings",
        "307.84": "account and create an auto transfer from your paycheck account.",
        "311.84": "I think that is cool.",
        "312.84": "And one extra tip I'm going to give it to you is that I personally use Maybank for my",
        "318.52": "savings account.",
        "320.44": "I'm going to show you why it's really cute.",
        "322.4": "Because if you think about it, it's very tough to find a Maybank account, right?",
        "325.48": "Really really tough to find a Maybank outlet in Singapore.",
        "330.08": "There are only a few of them, one in Chinatown, one in Raffles Place, you know, in the heartlands",
        "335.12": "it's very difficult to find them.",
        "337.0": "So it makes it tougher for me to go and withdraw money from Maybank.",
        "342.68": "So to me, I think that it was a good shot back then when many things were operating",
        "347.28": "in cash.",
        "348.28": "But I still use this strategy because I want to make it difficult for me to touch my savings.",
        "353.84": "I don't want to make it so simple.",
        "354.92": "If I open a POSB account or a DBS account just for savings, chances are they have easy",
        "359.64": "access all across the island.",
        "361.2": "I could easily get money with that card.",
        "363.84": "And to me, that is just making it difficult for me to save when I could just take a bank",
        "371.56": "that is very scarce in terms of the outreach for money.",
        "376.08": "And then I'll be like, hey, okay, Maybank, right?",
        "378.88": "Very difficult for me to draw money.",
        "380.48": "Cool stuff.",
        "381.48": "I'm going to make it easier for me to save.",
        "383.48": "Which brings me to my second point, is that if you have a savings plan this year, that",
        "387.84": "means you want to save a certain amount of money, share it with the people you trust.",
        "391.64": "How much you want to share for them to keep you accountable.",
        "395.48": "So if you want to save $2,000 this year, share it with the people you trust, share it with",
        "400.52": "your parents, share it with your loved ones, share it with your friends.",
        "403.36": "And then, because you trust them and you want them to keep you accountable.",
        "408.2": "To me, that is extremely important.",
        "409.6": "Because when you do something on your own, especially when you're new and you've not",
        "414.08": "done it before, you've not created a habit to it.",
        "417.0": "Whereas if everyone does it as a collective or someone else keeps you accountable to your",
        "420.8": "promise, that makes it a lot easier for you to do it because you have this emotional binding",
        "427.04": "to get this to work.",
        "428.28": "If you want to take this one step further, you can consider passing your savings bank",
        "433.08": "card to that person.",
        "434.96": "Of course, you don't give them the passcode, right?",
        "436.68": "You just give them the card.",
        "438.84": "And you will create a list of requirements for when these savings can be activated.",
        "444.24": "So they are kind of like your gatekeeper.",
        "447.2": "Give them 5 questions, like, when can you withdraw a savings?",
        "452.08": "When you lose your job.",
        "453.08": "When you lose your job, that means you lose your income, you need your savings to come",
        "455.56": "and back you up.",
        "456.56": "Or when you fall sick or something like that.",
        "460.28": "So you just need to create a list of requirements for when you can touch the savings and pass",
        "464.92": "that to your gatekeeper at the same time when you pass them the card.",
        "468.68": "So that they can keep you accountable and it creates a barrier for you to touch that",
        "473.04": "savings just for splurging, just for spending.",
        "477.36": "And I recommend this person that it's the best for everyone, which is your mother.",
        "482.96": "It doesn't matter how good your mom is financially, how well is she measuring, how well is she",
        "488.48": "managing her finances, but just pass her the card and have her be accountable to you and",
        "493.88": "you be accountable to her.",
        "495.32": "Don't give her the money, don't give her the password, just give her the card and engage",
        "500.8": "her within this accountability process.",
        "504.56": "If you do well this year, that means you manage to hit your savings goal, then buy her a meal.",
        "509.42": "She has done her part in helping you achieve this savings goal for the year.",
        "513.66": "So cool stuff, right?",
        "514.66": "First thing, you automate your savings contribution.",
        "518.18": "Use Maybank or some bank that is not prevalent in everywhere.",
        "521.9": "Next thing is you can pass this bank card to someone that you love and create this accountability",
        "528.58": "element for yourself and for them to keep you accountable too.",
        "532.42": "And of course the third thing which many people don't think about when they think about savings",
        "536.74": "is that maybe you want to set a budget for splurging.",
        "541.58": "So that is what I do and it made it very comfortable for me to save.",
        "546.02": "Because when you are always stuck in this idea that I got to cut back expenses, I got",
        "550.62": "to cut back expenses, I got to save, save, save, it makes it very uncomfortable because",
        "554.34": "you are always thinking of how to spend less.",
        "557.3": "But in actuality, there are certain things that will help you and certain things that",
        "560.82": "you like and you want to do and that's up to you.",
        "563.22": "It's cool stuff.",
        "564.7": "And why not let's factor that in into our expenses which is what I call the splurging",
        "569.26": "account.",
        "570.34": "So I have a bank account which I use for splurging and it depends on how you define splurging.",
        "575.26": "It can be buying new fashion, going to a restaurant, trying new experiences, catching a musical,",
        "582.14": "things that are not vital for your day-to-day survival but may help you to raise your quality",
        "588.16": "of life.",
        "589.82": "And to me that is maybe something like a splurge and I enjoy that.",
        "594.46": "I want to be able to enjoy spending and I want to be able to factor all these kind of",
        "598.58": "random spending and all these kind of random bursts of energy to buy something or do something",
        "603.78": "within my financials.",
        "606.18": "So it makes it a lot easier for me to save, for me to invest when I have a separate fund,",
        "612.34": "a separate account that is dedicated to spending.",
        "616.78": "And emotional spending or splurging or all these different kind of ad hoc expenses.",
        "622.18": "So let's say you set 10 to 15% of your income, maybe about $300, $400, $500 a month on splurging.",
        "629.94": "It's going to make it a lot easier for you to have fun because you are going to be targeting",
        "634.62": "to have fun and splurge and go and do all these things.",
        "638.28": "So it makes it emotionally comfortable to save.",
        "641.66": "And I hope these answers your questions as to how can we be smarter with savings and",
        "646.62": "More often than not, nobody really thinks about savings and spending actually are very connected.",
        "653.06": "So when you create that splurging account, it's going to help you and I hope it helps you.",
        "657.26": "So today I shared with you a few strategies to become a smart saver, to reach your savings",
        "662.26": "goals this year.",
        "663.26": "I'm sure maybe you have some interesting strategies or your friends have executed some interesting",
        "668.02": "strategies and feel free to talk to me.",
        "669.78": "I want to hear from you.",
        "671.58": "And to sum it all up, the three savings, the three smart saving strategies for the year",
        "676.14": "is to automate your savings contribution, save before you spend.",
        "680.02": "Number two, to share your plan with people you trust to keep you accountable.",
        "683.74": "And if you want to take it one step forward, you know, hand the bank card to someone, well",
        "688.54": "maybe your mother.",
        "690.38": "She will be extremely rigorous gatekeeper for you.",
        "693.06": "And the third is to set a budget for splurging so that you become very comfortable with spending",
        "698.9": "and very comfortable with savings because everything is budgeted and is strategized.",
        "705.38": "I want this to make it, I want to make this an easy journey for you.",

        "444.24": "You know",
        "444.64": "It's just very very very easy way to verify the individual to then decide whether you want to further invest",
        "450.96": "Right rather than you arrange for a meal. Oh my goodness. So expensive is so awkward",
        "455.24": "Right, so, you know do it right zero of date first date must always be low budget and sure which brings me to my second point",
        "462.8": "The second point to be financially smart when we are dating is to always a a always go Dutch",
        "470.0": "But at least for the first few times that you guys are meeting right first ten times",
        "474.2": "Let's let's do ten times why because I think that you know",
        "479.44": "Society has reached a level where you know, it is kind of given for both parties to be working",

        "499.24": "Whatever you want to do it. You cannot run away from finances. So right from the get-go",
        "503.6": "I feel that we need to set the expectations, right a lot of guys, especially",
        "508.68": "till today have a lot of you know have this kind of",
        "513.88": "Perspective that you know guys need to treat girls, right?",
        "516.16": "You know, if you're in a guy-guy relationship go-girl relationship, whatever it is, you know, there's always this like masculine",
        "523.96": "Partner that needs to be the one treating, you know, or in general. Okay these days I'm relationship",
        "529.66": "Have to define but the idea is about adjusting expectations because right from the very very start",
        "535.86": "you don't want to be on the grounds that you're always treating and it's it's a it's firstly a very bleeding process and",
        "542.7": "Secondly, it's like you want the other party to also be committing, you know",
        "547.54": "Financially because it is it is true that when someone commits financially that they feel, you know",
        "553.64": "They feel the pinch and when they feel the pinch they actually do more, right?",
        "557.66": "I think that is extremely important and I'm not being like sexist or something",
        "562.82": "But you know if especially ladies right when we talk about what I know a lot of ladies these days",
        "568.3": "Talk about like, you know, you want to be the independent women equal rights, etc, etc",
        "573.14": "Which is beautiful by the same time if that is the case, right then, you know",
        "578.3": "Please don't expect guys to treat because across the board",
        "581.98": "I still hear a lot of people telling me the guy must treat my first time I must treat one",
        "586.74": "I was like my goodness seriously times have changed you are making money. The guy's making money",
        "591.7": "Everybody's you know, we're all making about the same and we're all trying to create a life together",
        "596.38": "So right from the get-go set the expectation right always a but of course if you're together and it's a stable relationship already",
        "603.42": "Then yeah, you will be less calculative, you know, that's kind of how it works",
        "607.7": "But right from the start don't bother treating right don't if money it's what impresses the other person",
        "614.34": "You know then and I don't know what to say right if someone say but treat very gentleman",
        "619.38": "But okay, there are many other ways to show that you are a gentleman open that door, you know",
        "623.78": "Pull that seat usher her in usher him in whatever, you know, just",
        "629.94": "Yeah, it's not about paying for the bills, right?",
        "632.26": "So always a right remember that and brings me to my third point which is practice",
        "638.06": "small random gifting",
        "640.9": "I think this is very interesting and you know",
        "644.94": "Very smart if you ask me because you realize that you know these days there are like a lot of events right a lot of my",
        "651.38": "Holidays you have Christmas your Valentine's Day",
        "653.94": "You have you know all sorts of activities to try to get you to spend and a lot of these things right honestly have been",

        "666.42": "Expectation that you need to gift",
        "668.78": "But you also realize that during the holiday",
        "671.22": "Everything is very expensive",
        "672.94": "You go to the restaurant is two three times the price you buy a bouquet of flower is like ten times the price",
        "678.62": "You know why because people only buy flowers during that period of time, you know, at least that's that is the common understanding",
        "685.94": "So everything becomes super expensive and it's not like it's it's honestly just a flower. It's a meal, right?",
        "693.14": "It's not gonna like change this impression change the impression of of the individual to you and I'm gonna build really deep relationships",
        "700.54": "but what I observed is that",
        "703.18": "When you start to gift, right gifting is beautiful",
        "706.46": "It's a great way to show that you can show that you know",
        "709.74": "the person that you are interested in is within your you know sphere of thought and",

        "173.36": "We can invest in this relationship that we want to take this further doesn't mean is marriage",

        "196.48": "I mean if you are like super modern like polyamory or like",
        "202.92": "You know whatever then then that is a whole different ballgame. You know it's like I can't",
        "208.0": "Whoo whoo? I don't know man, but yes if you are in a stable relationship",
        "213.36": "I feel that there's certain things that we can do to you know get to know each other better and really just",

        "225.24": "Do we want to bring this even further to get married or to?",
        "229.92": "Confirm that this will be our life companion whether or not you get married",
        "234.68": "Okay, so the first thing that I feel the first budget that I feel you should have in a stable relationship is a common",
        "242.52": "household budget I",
        "244.84": "Get it a lot of people when they are still dating not married yet, right?",
        "248.68": "There isn't this idea of a common household budget because you're not a household yet",
        "253.96": "Right and then suddenly when when you get married",
        "257.24": "Out of a sudden there needs to be a common household budget because you live in the same house",
        "261.64": "You're gonna commit to many different things",
        "264.0": "but if we think about it to be able to get to that phase of like marriage and",
        "271.16": "Managing money together why don't we roll back a little bit slightly before marriage when things are stable?",
        "277.84": "to actually create a common household budget that we can you know use it to",
        "283.36": "Buy daily monthly kind of boring needs right like your shampoo like your grocery",
        "291.36": "You know all those very",
        "293.48": "mundane day-to-day kind of stuff of course if",
        "297.16": "Both of you are not together yet like you're not living together yet",
        "301.24": "That is more accurate if you're not living together",
        "303.08": "Then it can be a more creative way of managing a common household budget like a common Makan budget law",
        "310.12": "Right that means everybody commit to maybe $300 to $500 of Makan budget",
        "314.88": "And then you know we'll just draw down from here as we go along the important part is really about",
        "321.4": "managing money to get the managing small sums of money together to ultimately lead to",
        "328.0": "Managing money to get there because when you get married",
        "331.6": "I feel that you know it is it is a it is a given that you should manage money together as a collective",
        "338.2": "I don't really subscribe to the idea that you know you pay this I pay that and then just kind of point fingers at each",
        "345.16": "Other is like why you never do this why you never do that?",
        "347.2": "but actually when we are in when we are team when we are married when we are together when",
        "352.76": "You know for whatever reason that you ultimately decide to settle down this person",
        "357.04": "The goal is to support each other and not blame each other so in my view we need to manage money",
        "362.48": "Collectively so pre-marriage in a stable relationship state right you should already start to look at how to",
        "369.4": "manage a common budget",
        "372.04": "Right and I will just call it a common household budget",
        "375.32": "So of course it will be great if you shift in together",
        "378.04": "And you know start to get to know each other's day-to-day life because it is very different a weekend you go to",
        "384.44": "Your partner's place to you know have fun have sex right then",
        "387.72": "Then life carries on on the weekday, and then you meet up one of the nights",
        "391.0": "You know it's very different compared to when you live day to day together, and I understand that in Singapore",
        "396.88": "It is very expensive. You know rental prices are like just rent a room rise like six hundred dollars seven hundred eight hundred",
        "402.72": "Or depending on where you are at of course",
        "406.52": "You know it is very expensive, and I get it, but I highly recommend you to do it",
        "412.56": "you know whether or not it is expensive because",
        "415.64": "To me it is like yeah, you can see the renting a space together",
        "420.24": "It's very expensive, but when I look at it to commit to a life together. It is more expensive",
        "425.96": "Right so there must be a precursor and that precursor will be great if you know you can live together for a year",
        "433.32": "Just kind of do it",
        "434.8": "You know try it and see whether you can live together and manage that kind of common household budget",
        "439.88": "But if you are not at the level where you are staying together you can still manage a common household budget like what I just",
        "446.36": "recommend you to like you know manage a",
        "449.56": "Common Makan budget right so every time we go out together",
        "452.72": "We will draw down from this budget that will be great for everybody to start to learn and you know",
        "458.08": "Do this thing as a team rather than an individual which brings me to the second budget that you should have in a stable",
        "466.56": "Relationship and this budget is called the his or her budget",
        "470.6": "Essentially you realize that in this process of getting to know each other",
        "474.76": "There will be a lot of differences definitely there will be some similarities a common interest etc. But there are a lot of differences",
        "482.68": "you may be born into a different kind of family structure very you know dynamic by itself and",
        "490.72": "There will be lifestyle differences because you are brought up in a different",
        "494.6": "Structure you're brought up in a different culture so everyone is different you come together",
        "498.52": "That is definitely differences and the common difference and some of the common differences is you know one person wants to spend on",
        "506.64": "This thing and the other person does not want to spend on that same thing like maybe some like the lady like to spa like",
        "512.48": "She really loves to go to the spa, but a guy looks at is like wish amore",
        "516.12": "Why you know so boring or like the you know like the guy really likes to travel",
        "521.88": "But the lady doesn't like to travel or maybe the guy likes to travel and the other guy likes to travel also",
        "526.92": "You know so you realize that there are many different dynamics. You know between partners and different kind of lifestyle",
        "534.48": "Differences right and if you don't manage this properly it can become a problem, but when I look at it",
        "540.5": "How do I do it? It's like I always dedicate a certain amount of budget to his or her budget",
        "547.04": "Essentially is I know that if my partner likes to eat at a restaurant",
        "552.6": "I'm not a huge fan of restaurants",
        "554.8": "Especially where I live I'm living in subang now and in KL a lot of restaurants are not good enough",
        "560.96": "Because for the price you pay the things that they provide you is just not exciting enough for me because I cook really well",
        "567.64": "Okay, okay, at least everyone say I cook very well",
        "570.24": "But so that is how I look at it when my partner likes to go to the restaurant, but I personally don't like it",
        "577.04": "but it is it is a",
        "578.96": "It is a torn in the eye you know when when one one person really likes to go to restaurant the other person really just",
        "583.88": "Don't want to go so what I do I set a budget for it, so I know that",
        "589.04": "You know my partner likes likes to likes to go to the restaurant",
        "592.24": "I set a budget and when I look at it, so okay",
        "595.04": "I become a lot more emotionally calm to you know go on that",
        "601.28": "Direction of spending when it is not my interest right to me that is very important because sometimes",
        "607.04": "You know you never know what you learn in that process. You know like",
        "611.84": "There must be a reason why him or her likes a certain thing",
        "616.52": "So why not you know give yourself the little bit of budget to then explore that interest of them",
        "623.76": "With them so then you can you know get to know each other better and talk about it",
        "628.08": "It's like why you actually really like to come to restaurants",
        "630.72": "And then they will share with you and that is a great way to learn about each other and to manage that kind of lifestyle",
        "637.36": "Differences because you bound to have lifestyle differences right and trust me everyone likes to spend okay",
        "642.52": "They just like to spend on different things like my lot my friends think I don't spend money",
        "646.8": "It's not because I don't spend money",
        "647.84": "I just like to spend on certain things like I love to go backpacking and travel and get a new",
        "652.84": "Experiences and that is not something that everyone likes so there's always",
        "657.48": "Differences in spending different kind of things that you like to spend on so set a budget his or her budget",
        "664.2": "Specifically to cater to their needs right so if he him or her really likes to go rock climbing",
        "669.72": "You don't like it right",
        "670.72": "But you know you just dedicate a small budget and time to go and do do with him or her so that you get to",
        "676.28": "Know each other better so to me that is extremely important and the third budget",
        "680.68": "I'm gonna share with you is something that I feel everyone should have whether or not you're in a relationship",
        "686.92": "But in a relationship, this is you know especially important. It is what I call the",
        "692.88": "exploration budget",
        "694.92": "So many people stop exploring right they did you know a lot of people always say well. I'm very boring",
        "699.68": "I really do the same thing then I'll say what have you done differently",
        "702.84": "What have you tried differently you realize that many people's are no law",
        "706.44": "I just go back what go back home after work, and then you know the cycle just repeats",
        "710.72": "And of course you will never get new new experiences. You'll never see new insights because you stop exploring",
        "717.32": "When we're younger we are always exploring trying new things pushing boundaries, but as we go along somehow another",
        "724.04": "You know for whatever reason we go into repeat mode repeat repeat repeat",
        "728.84": "Which is fine because repeat creates something if you think about it right civilization only grew when",
        "735.36": "Nomads decide to sit down stay at one place and repeat built built built farm farm farm grow grow grow",
        "742.08": "But the reality is it gets boring because you're doing the same thing again and again and again so in a relationship",
        "748.12": "This happens also right you're always doing the same thing because after a while if you reach your equilibrium",
        "753.52": "You know what they like they know what you lie, and then you're always doing the same thing",
        "756.56": "It gets a little bit boring",
        "759.64": "So why not both of you set a common budget called exploration budget and do it set a time set a set a budget",
        "766.84": "And you don't go and try something different like go and go for a hike",
        "770.56": "You know go and try this new",
        "773.2": "Experiential dining place, so I'll go and pick up like art together",
        "777.32": "Go for a dance class together try things that you guys will never do in in",
        "783.24": "For for the eternity of your life so far and that will be very very fun because you share common experiences you build common",
        "790.64": "Experiences and in my view that is one of the best way to you know build",
        "794.6": "Understanding and build the relationship and get to know each other better to ultimately decide that do you want to take this even further?",
        "801.84": "right so",
        "803.56": "Do it man",
        "805.36": "Exploration budget and if you try something new try something interesting and you found that really really useful",
        "811.04": "You know between your partner, please share with me. Please share with us",
        "814.72": "We all want to build better relationship, and we are all looking for interesting activities to go for so with that",
        "821.16": "I'm gonna sum up today three budgets that you should have in a stable relationship number one is a common household budget to test run",
        "829.16": "Before you get married together right try to manage a common budget together",
        "833.88": "Before you know you take on this one step further on marriage and the next budget is a his or her",
        "839.24": "Budget because you both have lifestyle differences you want to be able to you know feel emotionally calm when you spend in their interest",
        "847.52": "And not yours, but through this process you will learn a lot of things about him or her right so that will be fun",
        "852.92": "And the third budget is exploration budget where both of you will try something that both of you never done before",
        "858.84": "To experience new new aspects of life and get to know each other better, so I hope you learn something useful today. See ya",

        "262.64": "a heavy airport tax as compared to if you fly from Johor.",
        "267.36": "You don't believe me, you go and try.",
        "268.92": "I've talked to a lot of friends about this thing.",
        "271.88": "Instead of flying out from Singapore, which a lot of people maybe stay in the West, stay",
        "275.84": "in the North, then they come all the way to Changi to fly out of, which okay, to be fair,",
        "279.84": "there are a lot of options.",
        "281.2": "But if some of the places you are trying to fly to, let's say Guangzhou, some of the other",
        "284.68": "places that I cannot remember exactly where, but Johor does provide.",
        "288.2": "I think Bangkok, the airport has a few of these kind of airlines, at least these kind of routes.",
        "294.28": "So if you stay in Woodlands, Jurong, all those places, actually you can consider taking a",
        "298.6": "day trip to Johor and just take this as a way of travelling.",
        "303.44": "Because when you do that, actually save a lot of money from flights.",
        "306.8": "Go and take a look at Johor.",
        "308.88": "Another data point I've gathered is recently I'm planning my trip to London.",
        "313.52": "So flying into London from KL's airport is not that expensive, right?",
        "318.72": "It's cheaper, a few hundred dollars.",
        "320.28": "But flying out of London directly is very expensive.",
        "323.8": "Of course, I've done some Googling here and there, and you realise that all these hub",
        "327.6": "places, right, whether it's Dubai, whether it's London, Singapore, Hong Kong, all these",
        "331.4": "airport hubs, they make money from the airport.",
        "333.8": "And how do they do that?",
        "334.8": "Airport taxes.",
        "336.24": "So after a while, I've learned to be able to plan my trip and take that travel as part",
        "341.98": "of the trip itself.",
        "343.48": "So going to Johor one day, then I fly out from Johor.",
        "346.76": "Let's say my plan this time round is to fly from KL to London.",
        "351.8": "This is my July trip, KL to London.",
        "353.76": "And from London, I'm going to move all the way down to Barcelona.",
        "356.52": "And then from Barcelona, I'm going to fly out.",
        "358.4": "So some people will be like, oh, this is so tiring, got to move around so much.",
        "361.88": "So okay, on average, maybe two weeks, three weeks trip, these kind of things make a lot",
        "366.4": "of sense.",
        "367.4": "So you kind of plan your route along with this idea that, oh, I can save a few hundred",
        "373.02": "dollars just to fly out of a particular airport.",
        "375.98": "And you can always make the trip a fun trip.",
        "378.66": "Don't think of travel as this, like, oh, I'm going to get from one spot to the next spot",
        "382.98": "to the next spot.",
        "383.98": "And definitely, you'll feel very tired.",
        "385.94": "And it doesn't help that there's a lot of travel agency in the past that make you do",
        "389.86": "that, right?",
        "390.86": "You hop on the bus, you go to the next stop.",
        "391.86": "It's very irritating, very annoying.",
        "393.46": "But if you think of this as a way of moving from point to point, as part of the travel,",
        "399.92": "as part of the journey, as part of experiencing new things, then this idea of, oh, maybe I",
        "404.72": "can move to another airport that's a little bit cheaper, you know, it's not that much",
        "408.92": "of a problem anymore.",
        "410.72": "And of course, some cities have multiple airports, so you can check all of their routes.",
        "415.32": "Just watch out for airport taxes.",
        "416.84": "Rule of thumb, air hubs always very expensive because that's the way they make money.",
        "423.04": "Which brings me to point number two, and that is to stay further away from the city center.",
        "429.34": "It's very intuitive and it's like, do I really want to do that?",
        "432.82": "I'm going to expand.",
        "433.82": "I'm going to expand this idea after a word from our sponsor.",
        "442.18": "So okay, I'm not like some kampung traveler.",
        "446.14": "I always go to the kampung, I always go to the outskirts of the city.",
        "450.3": "I'm a big fan of living in like slightly more outside because it's quieter.",
        "455.42": "You get to see more of the local life.",
        "457.66": "You get to experience the way of life of the local people.",
        "461.72": "Like a lot of people travel to Bangkok, okay, very common, but how many of you actually",
        "466.36": "been to this place called Talaplu?",
        "468.16": "Right, so I stayed there because my friend was staying.",
        "471.36": "I was sort of bunking with a friend.",
        "472.36": "Of course, that's another tip, right?",
        "474.22": "Have a lot of friends and bunk in with them.",
        "476.44": "You save a lot of money on lodging.",
        "478.36": "Thank you, friends.",
        "481.36": "That aside, because I did that, I get to experience the life of the local.",
        "485.7": "Apparently, Talaplu, which is a place in Bangkok, was where the Cantonese people and the Hokkien",
        "491.46": "people, essentially the Chinese people, when they first landed in Thailand, that's one",
        "495.3": "of the big places where they gathered.",
        "497.54": "So when you go there, you can still hear Cantonese, Hokkien, you know, just some dialect.",
        "501.94": "A lot of old people there are still speaking in that way.",
        "504.98": "It's very interesting.",
        "505.98": "It's like a Chinatown.",
        "506.98": "There are a few streets, a lot of food around.",
        "509.78": "It just feels super, super local.",
        "511.9": "Some of the best kueh shop, the best wonton mee shop I had in Bangkok itself is there.",
        "518.16": "So go and check that out.",
        "519.16": "Check that out.",
        "520.16": "It's an interesting, fun place.",
        "521.16": "But the idea here is first you need to understand how tourist places are developed and how do",
        "527.56": "they come about.",
        "528.56": "Barring aside all those big capital injection right from the get-go like your Disneyland",
        "533.76": "or in China, they have all these very ugly touristy spots that are like out in the weird",
        "539.62": "mountains and then you have to drive all the way there.",
        "541.98": "You go there and very cheesy, very old school.",
        "543.82": "Nobody goes there anymore.",
        "544.82": "Barring aside all those spots that are specifically made for tourism, most other tourist spots",
        "551.26": "like your Osaka walking shopping street or your Jonker street or even Chinatown in Singapore,",
        "557.7": "they all started as a place where the locals will go to.",
        "561.66": "So they were interesting, they were fun, the locals go there, a lot of people go there.",
        "565.3": "So other tourists start to come in, right?",
        "566.96": "So this is where all the locals hang out, everybody go there.",
        "570.0": "And then what's the next step?",
        "571.0": "The next step is money will come in.",
        "574.36": "Capital will start to come in to capitalize on this place, right?",
        "577.44": "So that they can open their shops, sell to the tourists because the tourists will give",
        "581.72": "them a bigger margin, blah, blah, blah.",
        "583.44": "And then it will squeeze out all these smaller merchants, right?",
        "586.16": "Because they cannot afford on the main street now.",
        "588.6": "So what happens?",
        "589.6": "They will shift to the sides of the streets or even further out.",
        "593.16": "But the fun part lies here.",
        "594.6": "The fun part is if you only go to the main tourist street, you will not be able to see",
        "600.06": "where the original merchants are.",
        "601.5": "Try to go to the left, to the right, go to the side streets that are around the area.",
        "605.22": "They tend to hover around the same place because they want to cater to the same crowd that",
        "609.34": "they've always catered to but they cannot afford the rent in pretty much the prime street",
        "614.3": "where they started.",
        "615.46": "So go to the side streets, you'll see a lot of local stuff, very fun, very interesting.",
        "620.22": "And why do I put it that way, right?",
        "622.16": "So when you understand how capital comes into, capitalise on this kind of tourist destination,",
        "627.64": "then you start to realise that at some point, the whole touristy area is built for tourists,",
        "633.16": "like Istanbul.",
        "634.16": "So if you go to Istanbul and you stay where the big mosque is, the Blue Mosque, you stay",
        "639.36": "where the Constantinople Wall is, everywhere is extremely touristy.",
        "643.8": "The Grand Bazaar, blah, blah, blah.",
        "646.6": "Honestly, as someone that travels frequently and is trying to go there and understand local",
        "651.22": "culture and understand how people live, what is it like here, it's horrible.",
        "657.5": "Touristy spots are horrible.",
        "658.5": "I know it's very convenient, you go down there, you get all these things but they are all",
        "662.18": "very artificial and is that really the kind of travel experience that you want?",
        "667.14": "Like I said, back to the point number one, which is travel can be part of your plan.",
        "671.5": "And I know a lot of people are very annoyed because every morning, I work, I shower, I",
        "677.3": "carry my bag, 7, 8am, I go on the MRT, I get to my workplace, I'm done, I come back.",
        "682.32": "So a lot of people have this annoyance about travelling but if you move around in a new",
        "686.44": "place, that's actually very fun, very interesting.",
        "689.52": "You're seeing all these, wow, what's that, what's that, what's that.",
        "692.32": "So there's a lot of things to discover on the go.",
        "695.68": "Do not let the jadedness that you have in your routine in your current life affect the",
        "700.4": "way you travel.",
        "702.66": "So big fan of staying in the outskirts of the city, especially when I was in Osaka.",
        "707.74": "I did stay in the prime area, in the middle of the city but after a while, I was like,",
        "712.06": "you know, and then I went all the way out nearer to this other shrine, I can't remember",
        "716.18": "the name but that was when I felt the way of the life of the locals.",
        "721.74": "And I would say for more of you, if you're listening in, please try to travel and please",
        "727.5": "try to live in the outskirts.",
        "729.14": "It's definitely more affordable, more fun, more interesting.",
        "732.32": "What I just wanted to tell you was to think about how capital then takes over touristy",
        "735.92": "spots and how if you want to enjoy a different way of life and try to understand the local",
        "741.08": "way of life, then you got to go out.",
        "742.68": "Go where the locals are, okay.",
        "745.2": "I've given you a few good spots to travel, they're all very affordable.",
        "748.32": "So check them out.",
        "750.92": "Which brings me to point number three on how do you get the most budget, most bang out",
        "756.0": "of your budget when you're travelling, that is to plan your days with multiple combination.",
        "762.74": "What does that mean?",
        "763.74": "A lot of times we travel, when I first started, of course I travelled in a group, friends,",
        "768.9": "bunch of us, we went and then after that I started travelling alone and I felt like,",
        "772.54": "oh, travelling alone is quite fun because I could just focus on myself, I do what I",
        "776.42": "want to do, I don't really need to care about whether my friend wants to go here.",
        "779.94": "But eventually it became a little bit more problematic in the sense of, I'm limited as",
        "784.68": "to the places that I can stay because if you stay alone, if you want to take the whole",
        "787.48": "apartment, it's very expensive.",
        "790.48": "And I'm also limited by the kind of dining options and the kind of activity options that",
        "794.32": "I can do.",
        "795.32": "Honestly, why would you want to go to a place and be like, you know, selfie on your own,",
        "798.8": "a bit lame.",
        "799.8": "So a lot of people take photos because it's a group, there's a memorial in it, you know,",
        "803.32": "but okay, if you want to take on your own, fine, do it, I'm not judging you.",
        "806.44": "But what I found out eventually as I've travelled to many places is you can travel as a group",
        "811.56": "but do not be stuck within the group.",
        "813.98": "So travel as a group plan, four of you can go on a trip together, share the apartment,",
        "818.34": "great, do your thing.",
        "819.74": "But you should have that one or two days of your own, right, or maybe one or two days",
        "823.7": "just you, okay, either can be a split up, three people, one people, or even you can",
        "828.1": "meet local people, right, and that's a great way, great fun, meetup.com, you know, go to",
        "832.66": "the local communities, there are a lot of ways to go about doing that, Facebook.",
        "836.26": "I think Facebook is still one of the most amazing places to kind of meet a bunch of",
        "839.78": "people, right.",
        "841.12": "So the idea here is instead of definitely travelling alone or travelling with your partner",
        "846.4": "or travelling as a group, what you can do is to kind of merge them together with the",
        "851.16": "core spine when you travel, right.",
        "853.12": "So seven days, 12 days, 15 days, when you guys travel, there's a core spine, what are",
        "857.96": "we going to do, what are we going to do, what are we going to do, what do we want to achieve.",
        "860.78": "And then in between, you can always do your own thing, right.",
        "863.96": "So it could just be like, oh, today we're going to have breakfast together, after that",
        "866.28": "do your thing, go to your library, do what you want to do, go and hipster, you know,",
        "870.14": "go and visit.",
        "871.14": "Like for me, I'm becoming a big fan of visiting universities and I'm going to try to interview",
        "874.66": "some of these university professors with leading ideas, right.",
        "877.26": "So yeah, it becomes a very interesting way of getting the most out of the budget because",
        "884.58": "firstly you're safe on renter because you're not renting alone, you get the freedom to",
        "889.22": "move around on your own whenever you want to, and also you can dine as a group which",
        "894.82": "gives you more options and more activities to choose from as a group.",
        "899.66": "So I think there is value in travelling as a collective without being bound to the collective,",
        "905.36": "right.",
        "906.36": "So chill with a few friends, you know, go and travel together but don't have to everything",
        "911.08": "do together.",
        "912.08": "I think that's a big part of how I look at it these days.",
        "915.2": "Of course, of course, travelling with friends can be very scary, can break relationships.",
        "921.28": "So my biggest recommendation to all of you is to try to travel to Melaka, right.",
        "926.64": "Go somewhere near, somewhere affordable, test out the friend, right, test out whether",
        "931.18": "you can actually travel together.",
        "933.66": "Some friends can hang out together, have a good drink, have a good laugh, play sports",
        "937.14": "but doesn't mean you can live in the same apartment for 20 days together or 15 days",
        "941.26": "or 7 days together, right.",
        "944.06": "So if you are testing out some friends, great, Melaka is always my top choice.",
        "948.62": "Go there, have a good time and then eventually when you feel more confident with that, you",
        "952.36": "can go further and travel further and travel as a group, multiple permutation, great, great,",
        "958.44": "great value for your budget.",
        "960.24": "Okay, so yeah, simple episode today.",
        "963.64": "I just wanted to share with you my tips and thoughts because firstly, I'm moving around",
        "967.4": "and secondly, I see a lot of people trying to move around.",
        "969.64": "So barring aside all your travel off season, Airbnb, all those stuff which a lot of people",
        "974.16": "talk about, these are the three pointers that I have for you to get the best of your buck",
        "978.16": "when you're travelling.",
        "979.46": "Number one is to watch out for airport taxes.",
        "981.62": "A lot of air hubs, very convenient to travel to but they usually charge you a lot and when",
        "986.22": "you fly in, it's fine because they're not taxing you to fly in.",
        "989.42": "When you fly out, it's a bit more expensive.",
        "992.74": "So what I tend to do is I fly into the air hub and then I'll try to find another way",
        "997.54": "to get back to where I started.",
        "999.94": "So that's great.",
        "1000.94": "A lot of nomads do that also and they move around but yeah, because you're not a nomadic,",
        "1004.02": "you just want to do a two-week trip, just watch out for airport taxes.",
        "1006.8": "Try to make that journey into a cheaper airport part of the journey.",
        "1012.04": "It is quite fun.",
        "1013.56": "Number two is to stay further away from the city.",
        "1017.12": "Of course, a lot of people have this annoyance, oh yeah, if I stay far away from the city,",
        "1021.72": "I got to move in and out.",
        "1022.72": "But hey, if you're travelling, you're having fun, the movement about is an experience in",
        "1028.04": "itself.",
        "1029.04": "And also, you don't need every day stay out of the city.",
        "1031.12": "You can stay two or three days within the city, get talk, talk, talk as a tourist and",
        "1034.98": "then you move out and go and experience life of the local.",
        "1038.94": "I think that's great value, great cultural insights.",
        "1042.06": "You get to see more things and everything is local price.",
        "1044.86": "It's much, much more affordable, like way more affordable.",
        "1048.3": "I just came from Turkey.",
        "1050.26": "In the heart of Istanbul where Constantinople is, it's easily two to three times, in fact,",
        "1056.18": "maybe three to four times the price of what I pay for the same thing in the local areas",
        "1061.04": "which eventually I spend a lot of time in.",
        "1063.32": "So yeah, think about that.",
        "1065.04": "And number three is plan your days with a multiple permutation in mind.",
        "1070.92": "So travel as a group definitely saves you an apartment.",
        "1073.56": "Eating together definitely gives you more options and activities.",
        "1075.92": "But sometimes you want your own time, you want your own experience.",
        "1078.96": "You just want to go to this library, then all your friends want to go, they want to",
        "1082.2": "go somewhere else.",
        "1083.2": "It's fine, go on your own, separate it out.",
        "1084.92": "So instead of saying, I have to solo travel or I have to go in a pair, I have to go in",
        "1087.96": "a group, you can always have multiple permutation as you move along.",
        "1092.02": "This gives you a lot of bang for your buck while meeting all the needs that you have",

        "252.84": "Keep and save more coins.",
        "255.0": "And then come back and buy the next toy.",
        "256.6": "So like, teaching him to realise that there are budgets.",
        "261.08": "And then I'll use books to also illustrate him the concept.",
        "263.72": "So I recently bought this book from Amazon.",
        "265.56": "And I asked him, which brother do you want to be?",
        "268.88": "And it's one about a Spendthrift brother.",

        "283.36": "So I can buy many, many things.",

        "285.56": "Okay.",

        "292.44": "I feel like hard work is kind of overrated.",
        "295.24": "It's important.",
        "295.96": "But greed is really the one that leads almost every single successful person to success.",
        "301.24": "Okay.",
        "301.84": "Yeah.",
        "302.36": "Because like, you can work hard.",
        "303.96": "But if you don't persevere through the tough times,",
        "306.36": "then you'll never have that breakthrough.",
        "307.68": "And I feel for me, like when...",
        "310.12": "I mean, if I look back at my journey, right?",
        "311.96": "I was a straight A student, but I'm not smart.",
        "313.68": "I don't think I'm smart.",
        "314.76": "You work hard.",
        "315.28": "Yeah, I work hard.",
        "316.2": "And I work smart.",
        "317.08": "Okay.",
        "317.36": "And my IQ, when I eat, confirm, okay, I do IQ test.",
        "319.88": "I don't score very high one.",
        "320.96": "So I know I'm not smart.",
        "321.96": "But because I know I have a goal and I persevere through it.",
        "325.76": "So that's how I got my straight A's.",
        "327.56": "And then like, same thing when I set my sights on something,",
        "330.56": "no matter how difficult.",
        "331.48": "I took my real estate exam when I was pregnant.",
        "334.24": "Yeah, it was difficult.",
        "335.84": "Because imagine being pregnant and handling a kid",
        "338.16": "and still having to study and work at the same time.",
        "341.44": "But I persevered.",
        "342.44": "And I really think it was just greed that got me through.",
        "344.36": "Same thing when it came to losing weight.",
        "345.96": "I lost 19 kg till date.",
        "347.48": "I really think it was all about greed.",
        "349.24": "Yeah, greed, perseverance, working hard,",
        "351.44": "but not like repeating things that don't work also.",
        "354.64": "And I really wish to instill this in my kids.",
        "357.8": "So that whatever comes in life,",

        "363.0": "I believe they'll be able to overcome anything",
        "364.96": "that life throws at them.",

        "369.48": "So I'd like to ask about family financial planning",

        "393.92": "what each other spending on.",
        "395.2": "So I would say sometimes,",
        "397.36": "but we weren't like, you know, neck or skull.",
        "400.0": "And then we also have a joint account,",
        "403.84": "but we don't use that for joint expenses.",
        "405.56": "Although I recommend couples do that.",
        "407.08": "Yeah. And the only reason why we don't is because like,",

        "418.04": "Yeah.",
        "419.6": "Correct. Correct.",
        "420.76": "But if you do that way,",

        "475.92": "I want also for them to see the impact of different decisions over time.",
        "480.88": "Yeah. So when I allocate to StockPicks versus Index Funds and Robos,",
        "486.56": "then they can track 18 years later, how does that look.",
        "489.44": "And it's more tangible to see.",
        "491.32": "We can always teach them.",
        "492.72": "But when you actually have skin in the game, it's a different thing.",
        "496.4": "Yeah. So I want to use that to show them the different paths",
        "500.08": "and let them choose how they want to invest on their own",
        "502.88": "or manage their money in the future.",
        "504.32": "Okay. So when they inherit the so-called investment account",
        "507.28": "and they're going to see that, okay, this is the Index Funds,",
        "509.64": "how it has been doing and then these are Active StockPicks",
        "511.36": "and how it has been doing and all that.",
        "512.88": "Correct. Correct.",
        "513.6": "Prior to that, because the skin in the game so far is you, right?",
        "516.04": "I mean, prior to that, they got to be built up with that knowledge.",
        "518.64": "Correct. Correct.",
        "519.56": "So it's a journey.",
        "520.44": "So they don't know they have an investment fund for now.",
        "523.2": "Of course they don't.",
        "524.2": "And that will change over time.",
        "525.72": "And also like we're off the mindset that, you know,",
        "527.96": "a lot of parents, they want to pay for their kids' university.",
        "530.72": "But like my husband and I feel that in the future,",
        "533.56": "a uni degree won't be as valuable as it is now anymore.",
        "536.16": "So if they don't want to go to university,",
        "539.16": "they want to go and start a business, then why not?",
        "542.12": "So we would rather have like a sum of money that's being invested.",
        "545.76": "And when we give it to them when they turn off age,",
        "547.84": "it's up to them how they want to spend it.",
        "550.12": "How about putting money into their CPF, the kids' CPF?",
        "552.96": "Oh yeah, we would.",
        "554.28": "Just that for now, we're trying to max out taxes.",
        "556.64": "So we have to top our own first.",
        "558.56": "Yeah, we top our own first.",
        "560.8": "Later on, then we do the kids.",
        "562.32": "Yeah.",
        "562.92": "So how does the investment family fund look like,",
        "566.24": "you know, in your own personal household?",
        "568.12": "Family fund.",
        "568.92": "Is it more risk averse?",
        "571.72": "You know, because it's, well, you got to plan for the future.",
        "574.56": "Uh, no, I think it's fair.",
        "577.0": "I would say moderate risk.",
        "579.16": "So we do have a longer time span, right?",
        "582.52": "Because it's all the way until retirement.",
        "584.72": "So if I gauge, we're in our 30s,",
        "586.56": "we have about like 20, 30 years of investments at least.",
        "589.56": "So I can afford to take a bit more risk",
        "592.0": "than someone who only has like a 5, 10 year time frame there.",
        "595.0": "So for the kids, it's even longer.",
        "597.16": "So we get to play around even more.",
        "598.68": "But because the kids, we want to teach them that thing that I mentioned also.",
        "602.28": "That's why we have different paths allocated for them.",
        "604.76": "So how do you allocate, um,",
        "606.32": "between active stock picking and index funds?",
        "608.76": "Based on opportunity.",
        "609.84": "Based on opportunity.",
        "611.12": "Yeah. Like if market crash, then easy.",
        "612.96": "More on indexes.",
        "614.44": "Yeah. Unless the active stock pick crash a lot as well.",
        "617.56": "Yeah. But if the outlook for the active stock pick don't look as good",
        "620.96": "and I feel it could continue to be depressed,",
        "623.52": "then I won't act so fast.",
        "624.64": "I might just deploy more on index funds first.",
        "626.72": "Okay. So personally, what are you doing right now?",
        "629.04": "In given the market crash, things are picking up again.",
        "631.76": "People are saying some would think that it's going to be a",
        "634.16": "further crash down the line.",
        "635.56": "You should have some more chance, right?",
        "637.48": "And you're just looking at opportunities?",
        "639.36": "We do.",
        "640.92": "I think it's hard to predict where the future goes.",
        "643.28": "So I'm just deploying.",
        "644.28": "But I also do think that",
        "645.52": "we came out of a period of unprecedented gains.",
        "649.04": "If you look at the S&P, right,",
        "651.12": "at all the decades in the last 40 or 50 years,",
        "655.8": "the one that we just came out of was 400 plus percent.",
        "660.2": "All the others, right, so it was 400 plus.",
        "662.4": "Then you go back another 10 years, it was 200 plus.",
        "664.56": "Then it was like negative 14 or something.",
        "667.16": "Then 200 plus again and 200 plus.",
        "668.92": "But the one we just came out of, 400 plus.",
        "671.16": "That's because of the 2020 jump, right?",
        "674.16": "No, it's also because of the",
        "676.76": "flash money that's going into the system.",
        "680.04": "Quantitative easing.",
        "681.16": "Correct, the QE.",
        "682.0": "When you go up so fast,",
        "683.24": "you will have to come down also before it continues.",
        "685.88": "So I feel like the down hasn't really been down yet.",
        "689.04": "Yeah, that's why I'm taking a more",
        "690.88": "cautious wait and see approach.",
        "692.88": "And we have slowed down the pace",
        "694.52": "at which I'm deploying our money.",
        "696.08": "Okay, so you're still deploying at some level,",
        "698.4": "but you're slowing it down.",
        "699.44": "Slowing it down.",
        "700.24": "Yeah, you just don't know if there's gonna be",
        "702.92": "a further crash down.",
        "704.2": "Of course, nobody can predict anything.",
        "705.4": "Yeah, like if my trend was X dollars each time,",
        "707.88": "now I'm reducing it to X divided by two.",
        "709.88": "So I can make it last twice.",
        "711.24": "Okay.",
        "712.08": "Yeah, you're not waiting by the sidelines totally.",
        "713.96": "No, no, no.",
        "714.8": "Because some people are holding cash, you know.",
        "715.64": "I think it's so hard to wait on the sidelines",
        "717.44": "because the market can turn against you so fast.",
        "719.64": "And unexpectedly.",
        "720.72": "And then you'll be like, when you see it turn,",
        "722.04": "you're like, is this a dead cat bounce?",
        "724.04": "Or is this a really good turn?",
        "725.48": "You won't know.",
        "726.32": "Really rarely.",
        "727.16": "Exactly, exactly.",
        "728.0": "Then when it goes up and if it continues going up,",
        "729.64": "you're like, no, I think it's fake.",
        "731.08": "I'll come back down.",
        "732.04": "So it's very hard.",
        "732.88": "The psychology works against you.",
        "734.68": "Yeah, so I feel like just deploying actively makes sense,",
        "737.6": "but you can afford to slow down",
        "739.48": "if you're of the view that it could get worse.",
        "742.16": "Yeah, it's so hard to read the markets nowadays.",
        "743.68": "It is.",
        "744.52": "I look at it, I know.",
        "745.36": "I'm like, what is happening?",
        "746.2": "What's going on, man?",
        "748.08": "Yeah, but okay, so we don't know.",
        "750.16": "You just deploy.",
        "751.2": "Yeah.",
        "752.04": "Maybe you deploy a bit less,",
        "753.16": "but that's your strategy going forward.",
        "755.32": "Okay, so that's investments.",
        "757.24": "And yeah, you talk about investments on the blog too, right?",
        "760.0": "Yeah, I do.",
        "760.88": "It's just that I no longer put the whole thesis.",
        "763.56": "I used to when like, you know, things go IPO",
        "766.52": "or I'll write like my entire stock thesis on the blog.",
        "769.12": "But then there were a couple of instances",
        "771.36": "when I just overheard people talking about me in public",
        "773.88": "and they didn't know who I was, right?",
        "775.84": "And then they'll be like, yeah,",
        "776.68": "I saw a budget-based book that she invested in this stock.",
        "779.24": "Yeah, I'm going to buy.",
        "780.44": "And that's all I heard.",
        "781.28": "And then I got very worried.",
        "782.12": "I'm like, oh, shucks.",
        "782.96": "People just-",
        "783.8": "People might not read your thesis.",
        "784.76": "Yeah, they're just scrolling all the way to the bottom",
        "787.08": "and just seeing whether is it a buy or don't buy",
        "789.76": "and then make a snap judgment based on that.",
        "791.92": "And I felt like that was very irresponsible.",
        "794.36": "I didn't want to contribute to that.",
        "796.72": "So I stopped putting up full thesis on my blog",
        "799.92": "and I moved it to Patreon",
        "801.04": "whereby I get to have more conversations with the people.",
        "803.72": "Yeah, and because like, it's not,",
        "805.28": "when it's free and public, right?",
        "807.04": "You cannot control who's looking at it.",
        "808.68": "It could be a 17 year old.",
        "809.8": "It could be a 40 year old who is experienced.",
        "811.6": "It could be someone who doesn't know anything",
        "813.48": "but respects you a lot.",
        "814.56": "And I cannot control what they do",
        "816.4": "if they don't talk to me about it.",
        "818.16": "Yeah, whereas on a more private platform,",
        "820.68": "people can engage me and they'll ask questions",
        "822.72": "and all and I can reply them.",
        "823.8": "So there's a bit more control in that way.",
        "825.76": "And there's also with lesser audience,",
        "827.32": "you only get those who are willing to support you",
        "829.4": "and pay for the work, the in-depth research that you do.",
        "832.44": "So I run a subscription service.",
        "834.04": "And on that platform, right, it's easier for me to cut",
        "838.44": "compared to on the blog where it used to be all free and all.",
        "841.0": "And, you know, I used to do that a lot",
        "843.16": "during the 2016 to 2018 period.",
        "846.6": "And then I just stopped.",
        "847.64": "Because on Patreon, you can filter out the people.",
        "849.68": "Correct.",
        "850.28": "Yeah, and you're in closer communication with them",
        "852.96": "instead of like, you know, somebody just",
        "854.88": "follow your buy and sell recommendation.",
        "856.52": "Exactly.",
        "857.04": "And I know who's on my Patreon.",
        "858.64": "So, you know, they are also open",
        "861.24": "to have a communication channel with me at any time.",
        "863.64": "And it's really a lot better, I feel, in that way",
        "866.16": "versus always just publishing on...",
        "868.92": "I mean, free is great.",
        "870.12": "I like free too, right?",
        "871.36": "But I think being in a position where I have realized",
        "874.88": "the impact that my words can have on others,",
        "877.32": "I'm a bit more cautious now.",
        "879.48": "I don't want people to be misled into it.",
        "882.0": "So even when like, you know, during the whole crypto bull run",
        "884.92": "and everyone was trying to get into crypto",
        "887.24": "and trying to open accounts at all different places, right?",
        "889.84": "I was very cautious about the ones that I pick and wrote about.",
        "893.48": "Yeah, some had affiliate, some didn't.",
        "896.28": "Even if they were good but didn't have an affiliate,",
        "898.12": "I would just talk about it anyway.",
        "899.72": "Yeah, and if they were not so good",
        "901.64": "but offered really good affiliate fees,",
        "903.72": "I would eliminate them.",
        "905.2": "Yeah, so that's the back end thing",
        "906.84": "that I think people don't really see.",
        "907.96": "Yeah, I think crypto is a bit more F-y, do you feel?",
        "910.28": "Like writing about crypto.",
        "911.64": "Yeah, but we do need more content about crypto",
        "913.76": "so people can make better informed choices as well.",
        "916.2": "Good point.",
        "917.0": "But the authorities aren't doing that.",
        "918.76": "Are they not?",
        "919.64": "They're not.",
        "920.08": "They're not putting out enough content about crypto.",
        "921.72": "You think there's a lack?",
        "922.96": "There's a huge lack, man.",
        "924.0": "Okay.",
        "924.64": "Yeah, so it really all boils down to people like us",
        "927.88": "and the few crypto publications to do that education.",

        "237.12": "and then you present it, but your face is behind the camera.",

        "270.16": "with what a mature grownup or adult will do.",
        "273.96": "For myself, if I think working backwards",

        "280.2": "When did you first like, okay, I'm adulting.",
        "282.68": "Now I'm an adult and I have adult responsibilities.",
        "285.24": "I think it comes with, and the realization can happen",
        "287.8": "at any point of your life, right?",
        "289.68": "It's not really tied to an age, like when you graduate,",
        "290.88": "although that's when it happens for most people.",
        "293.36": "You come to the realization that you are responsible",
        "296.6": "for your own life and for sustaining that life.",
        "299.2": "And it can also come together with realizing",
        "301.28": "that you might be responsible for someone else's life.",
        "303.64": "It could be your parents.",
        "305.32": "It could be your children, if you're in that stage already.",
        "308.76": "So it's like understanding that you have that burden",
        "311.92": "of responsibility on you, and then taking steps",
        "314.88": "to do the things that would help you support",
        "319.68": "and sustain that life.",
        "320.76": "A big part of it is knowing for yourself",
        "323.08": "that you cannot really live",
        "324.24": "in the blissful ignorance anymore.",
        "327.28": "And I think many associate adulting",
        "329.68": "with very straightforward, like financial related tasks",
        "332.88": "or like knowing what phone plan to choose",
        "335.2": "or understanding CPF or knowing what the heck are taxes",
        "338.24": "and how much you have to pay.",
        "339.64": "And these are for sure like the low hanging fruit",
        "342.04": "of things that you should ideally seek to know more about,",
        "346.56": "not for its own sake, but because these are things",

        "365.0": "Yeah, were there any skills that you have to pick up?",
        "366.92": "How did you get started?",
        "368.28": "When did you realize that, okay.",
        "369.48": "For myself, I think the financial management came",
        "373.0": "before the concrete realization",
        "375.2": "that I have to be the adult now.",
        "377.28": "And that was when I was in JC,",
        "379.68": "I, for the first time, I got my own money",
        "382.92": "through a scholarship when I was in school.",

        "386.96": "as allowance, that was money that was mine.",

        "394.2": "which is when you can get an ATM card.",
        "395.96": "So that's when I started tracking what I was spending on.",
        "399.56": "And a lot of it was like food and whatever other things",
        "402.44": "that I could buy online.",
        "404.2": "Of course, at that time, I didn't know about investing.",
        "406.4": "I didn't know about any sort of budgeting framework.",
        "408.88": "All I knew was that I needed to write down",
        "411.16": "what I was spending on and also how much money I had left.",
        "414.76": "So that was the very, very foundation.",
        "417.2": "And then that feeling of adulting,",
        "419.64": "which is also about maturity, right?",
        "422.88": "And not just about the things that you do,",
        "424.4": "but your relationships with people",
        "426.12": "and how you treat them and how you are around them.",
        "429.08": "That maturing is part of the adulting journey, I think.",

        "657.44": "Like how the heck do you get a HDB at 24 years old?",
        "660.28": "So it starts out with intriguing situation,",
        "663.28": "because the general belief is that",

        "673.84": "So you need to get resale, then you need capital.",
        "676.04": "Yeah, only resale and you need money.",
        "678.96": "But in terms of the application process,",

        "698.48": "and like the most common exceptions,",
        "700.08": "they will have a scheme for it.",

        "705.0": "or you're an orphan.",
        "706.28": "So for myself, it was the non-citizen family scheme",

        "711.48": "So yeah, so that was definitely something that was not known.",

        "732.16": "and is in the video.",
        "733.76": "Right, you were forced by circumstances in a way.",
        "736.04": "I think when people saw the title, it feels aspirational.",

        "739.56": "What can I do to buy a HDB at 24 years old?",
        "742.76": "I think I shattered that.",
        "744.16": "Yeah, exactly.",
        "745.0": "I undercut that.",
        "745.84": "And then it's like the bait and switch,",
        "747.0": "and you went into something deeper.",
        "748.28": "Yeah.",

        "751.04": "your own personal situation.",
        "752.48": "And my takeaway was that it's really personal.",
        "755.16": "Everybody's situation is different.",
        "757.2": "And so this is what you have to go through",
        "759.6": "as compared to someone who aspires to get a HDB",
        "762.4": "at a young age, but you were forced by circumstances.",
        "765.48": "I didn't think about it as being aspirational, actually.",
        "768.12": "Like the whole time when I was going through the process",

        "771.68": "oh, it's a heavy story,",
        "773.16": "like a lot of regret and frustration.",
        "775.64": "Like the thought of it being aspirational or inspiring",
        "778.16": "came a lot later.",
        "779.88": "After I published the video,",
        "780.72": "even the thumbnail, I remember I took a picture",

        "937.4": "Really?",
        "938.24": "I mean, why else?",
        "939.08": "Because until February, nobody was looking at it.",

        "979.88": "or advising you to do.",

        "1018.76": "I think buying a house can be considered wealth.",

        "1039.76": "So just having something as broad as that",
        "1042.24": "can help as a starting point.",
        "1043.64": "Yeah, and to keep you like in that general direction",
        "1046.48": "or trajectory.",
        "1047.8": "Yeah, I've seen like 10% for contributions,",
        "1050.4": "10% to parents, 10% that kind of thing.",

        "1054.6": "I've also heard people saying that maybe 30% to wealth",
        "1056.8": "is too much and 50% is meant to be like for fixed expenses",

        "1394.72": "But the gist of it is that you don't buy anything",
        "1396.8": "that is outside of the necessity category.",
        "1400.68": "And it could be that you do a no buy",

        "1404.56": "Like if you identify, say, clothing as your problem area",
        "1407.8": "that you want to do a no buy on,",
        "1409.04": "you can just restrict yourself in that category.",

        "1416.04": "Because if it's a lifestyle, then it's just your life.",
        "1418.0": "But it's more like a short-term project, I would say.",
        "1421.04": "It could be a month, it could be a year.",
        "1423.96": "And it's kind of like committing to an exercise regime",
        "1427.44": "or a specific diet for a certain period of time.",
        "1430.24": "So I see it in that kind of way.",
        "1432.48": "And then the low buy is a variation of that,",
        "1434.04": "which means that you impose a certain restriction",
        "1436.72": "on yourself.",
        "1437.56": "So for myself, it's $50 a month",
        "1439.04": "on what I consider is a non-necessity.",
        "1442.16": "And people do it for all kinds of reasons.",
        "1444.04": "It could be for something as simple",
        "1445.88": "as wanting to save money for that month.",
        "1447.8": "A lot of the times I see people doing the no buy",
        "1450.72": "because there is something in their behavior",
        "1452.68": "or their mindset that they want to change.",
        "1455.04": "Or like a no buy or a low buy,",
        "1457.6": "where there is a restriction on the amount",
        "1460.44": "or the quantity that you can buy, that you can purchase,",
        "1463.24": "that really helps with sort of maybe resetting",
        "1466.04": "or helping you reevaluate some of your beliefs",

        "1472.04": "The reason why you put the brakes on spending, right?",
        "1474.2": "Is because like, say you're driving in a car",

        "1477.36": "you cannot repair the car and drive at the same time.",

        "1481.24": "You gotta stop.",
        "1482.08": "Yeah, you gotta stop.",
        "1482.92": "Look for help or just help yourself.",
        "1484.24": "The whole emotional process from like wanting the thing",
        "1487.52": "to actually buying the thing, it's an ongoing cycle.",
        "1490.28": "You're wanting the thing and then you're buying the thing.",
        "1492.88": "But if you interrupt that cycle,",
        "1495.2": "you stop at the buying part,",
        "1496.6": "then you can analyze the wanting part",
        "1498.48": "and why you want something,",
        "1500.88": "why you think you want something.",
        "1502.56": "So that's what I'm doing with this no buy or low buy.",
        "1505.48": "I am interrupting that thought process",
        "1507.32": "so that I can better understand myself",
        "1509.08": "and what my motivations are without like the end result,",
        "1514.12": "the consequence of already having bought the thing.",
        "1516.72": "So I am stopping the car and seeing how I can like",
        "1519.88": "change certain things or repair certain things.",
        "1522.64": "Okay, can I call it a detox in terms of a personal finance?",
        "1526.28": "Because you used the diet example just now, right?",
        "1528.16": "So it's a change of money habits",
        "1529.6": "and suspending habits.",
        "1531.2": "So essentially, like I mentioned,",
        "1532.68": "it's not a permanent thing.",
        "1533.56": "It's not a permanent lifestyle that you have to stick to,",
        "1536.28": "but you can try it for half a year, one year.",
        "1538.32": "So for yourself, it's been half a year?",
        "1539.96": "Yeah, I've been doing it for one year.",
        "1541.68": "One year, so you've been updating regularly",
        "1543.72": "the money diaries on YouTube channel.",
        "1545.16": "What has been your experience so far?",
        "1547.0": "Let's sum up half a year.",
        "1551.4": "Well, it's some of my most vulnerable videos",
        "1553.32": "because firstly, I'm sharing everything that I bought.",
        "1557.32": "So vulnerable.",
        "1560.0": "Yeah.",
        "1561.88": "So I'm sharing that.",
        "1563.48": "And then also the mindset changes over the last six months.",
        "1568.04": "I go into depth about that.",
        "1569.68": "So I did a mid-year check-in",
        "1572.16": "and something that has come up was",
        "1575.52": "me feeling quite out of place",
        "1578.96": "because shopping and spending money is so normal, right?",
        "1584.04": "But when I purposely take myself out of that cycle,",
        "1588.8": "when I stop driving,",
        "1590.04": "it gives you a different perspective.",

        "1593.52": "by the side of the road,",
        "1594.64": "then you're kind of lonely",
        "1595.48": "because everyone's going on without you.",
        "1597.56": "And something that I realized was that",
        "1599.96": "I don't really know what to do when I'm not shopping",
        "1602.12": "or when I'm not trying to actively desire things",
        "1605.04": "and work towards buying the thing that I desire.",

        "1611.68": "but I'm not used to not having this pastime.",
        "1615.64": "And so that has been something that I need to reflect on.",
        "1621.92": "Like imagine you've been a meat eater all your life",
        "1625.04": "and then suddenly you cut out meat.",
        "1626.4": "Then you're like, what do I put in my meals?",
        "1627.96": "Yeah. And then all your friends are meat eaters.",
        "1629.44": "When you go out for gatherings,",
        "1630.4": "they're still eating meat.",
        "1631.32": "Yeah.",
        "1631.92": "And leaving you behind.",
        "1633.44": "So what do you do with your time, right?",
        "1635.16": "Like when you're not shopping,",
        "1636.52": "when you're not actively participating in...",
        "1640.68": "No, I am still participating, but at a much reduced level.",
        "1644.04": "Do you think parts of our identity,",
        "1645.64": "I mean, in this modern society,",
        "1648.12": "what you spend on, it forms part of who you are.",
        "1651.44": "Yeah.",
        "1652.68": "So I'm trying to find how else I can reinforce my sense of identity",
        "1657.48": "without needing to buy the things to reinforce that identity.",
        "1660.2": "Right. So without all this, who are you?",
        "1662.36": "Do you have that thought?",
        "1663.4": "Who am I in this process?",
        "1665.88": "I think that's a really valuable part of the low buy",
        "1668.84": "because it really puts you through this grueling process of",
        "1671.56": "self-reflection and self-evaluation.",
        "1673.56": "And it's not fun.",
        "1674.48": "I mean, you're still mulling over it.",
        "1676.36": "You're still thinking about it.",
        "1677.76": "There's no answer.",
        "1679.4": "Yeah. I've never committed to this length of a project before.",
        "1684.56": "So we'll update at the end of the year what my feelings are.",
        "1687.76": "But right now, at the six month mark, this is where I'm at.",
        "1691.16": "And that wasn't what you were expecting when you started, right?",
        "1693.2": "This realization that you're having right now.",
        "1696.44": "Did it serve what you intended for in the first place when you started this low buy year?",
        "1701.64": "Yeah, but expecting it is not the same as going through it.",
        "1704.24": "Ah, you kind of knew that you would.",
        "1706.64": "I knew intellectually that I'm going to probably go through some hard shit,",
        "1709.88": "but going through it is another thing.",
        "1712.36": "OK, climbing the mountain itself is another thing.",
        "1714.48": "You know it's going to be tiring, climbing this mountain.",
        "1716.48": "That's right.",
        "1717.24": "Going through it is another thing.",
        "1718.32": "Yeah. And a worry that I had was that I'll just give in.",
        "1721.72": "I'm just going to give up.",
        "1722.6": "In public, because you're doing it online.",
        "1724.4": "Yeah, so I think having the public YouTube channel helps.",
        "1726.56": "Yeah, accountability.",
        "1727.84": "But I am committed to the outcome, whatever it is.",
        "1730.96": "Like whatever realization I come to, the person that I become at the end of this year,",
        "1735.12": "I'm committed to seeing it through.",
        "1737.16": "It's just hard.",
        "1738.04": "I'm really interested in this journey of yours.",
        "1740.28": "I mean, it reminds me of a friend who quit Facebook.",
        "1743.12": "You know, several people have done that, right?",
        "1744.48": "Closed their Facebook accounts.",
        "1745.68": "And then, but what fills up that extra time that you have?",
        "1748.12": "I mean, OK, social media detox.",
        "1749.76": "OK, I'm using the word detox again.",
        "1750.76": "Yeah, that's a really good comparison.",
        "1752.6": "Right. And then so what fills up the time?",
        "1754.52": "Like, is it, did you use something else that is the equivalent of Facebook to fill up the time?",
        "1759.12": "You know, if you do that, you know, then what's the point, right?",
        "1762.56": "OK, yeah, I don't really have a clear answer.",
        "1764.36": "I have a friend who did that and then she was like saying,",
        "1766.08": "Oh, I just read more books.",
        "1767.16": "But I don't know, is it what she wanted when she turned off her Facebook account?",
        "1772.28": "It's not a one for one replacement, right?",
        "1774.6": "Like you just because you quit one habit, you immediately find another habit",
        "1777.52": "that can substitute what that previous habit was.",
        "1780.44": "So like reading books is not the same as scrolling social media.",
        "1783.64": "So I'm sure there was something else in there.",
        "1786.08": "Yeah, I think this whole journey of like really...",
        "1788.72": "Another episode.",
        "1789.52": "It's another episode.",
